<blockquote><p>We would like to take this opportunity to thank you for your&nbsp;interest in the&nbsp;Broadcast Assistant&nbsp;position with&nbsp;the&nbsp;Los Angeles Dodgers. Although your resume<span style="color: #ff0000;">&rsquo; [stray apostrophe]</span>, educational and work experience was quite impressive<span style="color: #ff0000;"> [this whole clause is severely wounded ... gushing blood]</span>, we selected a candidate whose background more closely matched the&nbsp;Department&rsquo;s needs. We will however, retain your resume<span style="color: #ff0000;">&rsquo; </span><span style="color: #ff0000;"> [stray apostrophe] </span>on file should a future need arise where we may utilize your expertise.</p>
<p>You may want to occasionally peruse our website at www. Dodgers.com <span style="color: #ff0000;">[random space in url]</span> for available employment opportunities<span style="color: #ff0000;">,</span> <span style="color: #ff0000;">[unnecessary coma] </span>and apply again at that time.</p>
<p>On behalf of the Los Angeles Dodgers we wish you success with <span style="color: #ff0000;">[should be in]</span> your career pursuits.</p></blockquote>
<p><strong>Style and grammar errors are marked for your convenience.&nbsp; At least when I applied to be a receptionist for the Yankees they had the courtesy not to get back to me.</strong></p>
