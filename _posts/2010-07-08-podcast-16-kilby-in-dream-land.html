<p>In this episode of the Pitchers and Poets Podcast, we discuss the upcoming All Star festivities, from Chris Berman's tired Home Run Derby act to All Star fashion (though we didn't get to Alyssa Milano's CHONE projections for the celebrity game). Then it was on to baseball cards, as we cracked a couple of Topps 2010 packs and dug through the Orioles and Pirates commons to find some buried treasure, and learned of the glory of Brad Kilby.</p>
