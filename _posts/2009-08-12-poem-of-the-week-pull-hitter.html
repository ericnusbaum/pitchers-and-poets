<p>Mariner Russell Branyan is having his best year as a pro, the proverbial "career year." Credit may go to a <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/mariners/2009208076_mari12.html">computer-aided eye exercise program</a>, or to statistical anomaly, but the big lefty has kept the Ms over .500 and in sniffing distance of the Wild Card in a tough AL West division. In honor of Branyan--a hard-swinging pull hitter--we present "Pull Hitter" by R. Gerry Fabian, via <a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_pull.shtml">Baseball Almanac</a>. In a year when every pitch must look to him like a grapefruit, this poem might remind Russell of those long minor league nights, after and before another bus ride, when the latest chance at four bases floats inches past the pole, and a career<br />
.234 hitter grounds another chopper to the first baseman, longing one more evening for the major league minimum.</p>
