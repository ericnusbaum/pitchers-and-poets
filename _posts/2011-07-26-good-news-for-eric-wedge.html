<p>Perhaps the most interesting aspect of the Mariners&rsquo; recent fall from grace is the lack of acrimony inspired by it.&nbsp; There are plenty of stories in the national media breaking down the quantitative futility; everyone, after all, loves an outlier.&nbsp; The local fan base is mourning the loss of Eric Wedge&rsquo;s mustache almost as much as the team&rsquo;s season.&nbsp; Wedge, although capable of throwing out his share of baffling lineups, is generally respected as a manager. &nbsp;Jack Zduriencik, unlike his predecessor, has made the kind of mistakes that at least follow some line of logic.&nbsp; Expectations were reasonably tempered.&nbsp; Even on the fifth of July, when the team was .500 and two and a half games out of first, everyone secretly knew that this was a roster capable of dropping a dozen games in a row.</p>
<p><a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/07/26/good-news-for-eric-wedge/ew1/" rel="attachment wp-att-3909"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3909" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/07/ew1.jpg" alt="" width="400" height="263" /></a></p>
<p>Of course, as of July 26, 2011, the Mariners have outdone themselves, accomplishing a feat only twenty teams have done since the American and National Leagues merged in 1903.&nbsp; And with a truly historical run of failure, Wedge and Zduriencik have been put on the hot seat almost by default.&nbsp; But as it turns out, losing fifteen or twenty games in a row isn&rsquo;t the death knell for a career one might think.&nbsp; The list:</p>

<p>Eric Wedge, as it turns out, has joined some pretty respectable company in the past two and a half weeks.&nbsp; This isn&rsquo;t as surprising as it seems; if you stick around the game for thirty or forty years, you&rsquo;re bound to see some streaks, good and bad.&nbsp; Still, several of these managers (Herzog, Kuhel, and Mauch) were first-year managers, and were given at least another year to prove themselves.</p>
<p>Many of the teams who fired coaches after losing streaks did so under extenuating circumstances.&nbsp; Tenney and Collins plied their trade during the player-manager era of baseball; Tenney was traded after his 1907 season, and released at the age of forty after 1911.&nbsp; Collins, the Hall of Fame third baseman, was stripped of his managerial duties mid-season, a full eighty games after the end of the twenty-game losing streak.</p>
<p>Ted Turner gave Dave Bristol a ten-day leave of absence in 1977 so that he could manage the team himself, until N.L. President Chub Feeney stepped in and slapped the rulebook in his face.&nbsp; Turner somehow persuaded Bristol to come back as a lame duck.&nbsp; The world remembers the 1988 Baltimore Orioles for its staggering 0-21 start to the season, but Ripken, Sr. was actually fired after only six games.&nbsp; Replacement-level manager Frank Robinson lost the other fifteen.</p>
<p>Of the nineteen managers, three of them were fired after and because of their losing streak (Collins, Fohl and Bristol).&nbsp; Four were enshrined in the Hall of Fame.</p>
<p>Where does this leave Eric Wedge?&nbsp; Probably in neither category.&nbsp; Miller Huggins once said that &ldquo;a manager has his cards dealt to him, and he must play them.&rdquo;&nbsp; Nobody envies Wedge&rsquo;s hand.&nbsp; He can&rsquo;t be accused of losing the players, and he&rsquo;s shown a willingness to be flexible with his roster without making constant, desperate changes. &nbsp;But for lack of a better alternative, we continue to measure managers by wins and championships. &nbsp;Gene Mauch might prove a solid comparison: a pretty good manager who led some pretty awful teams.</p>

<p>The Seattle Mariners are a fascinating ballclub right now; rarely has a team lost so much and had so little meaning attached to it.&nbsp; Usually, this kind of unabated failure beats down even the sensible fan, wears them raw until they need something, anything to be done.&nbsp; They attach responsibility to whatever they can reach, and usually the field leader is the first in line.</p>
<p>In the case of the Mariners, however, there are no mutterings about intangibles, no hidden knowledge of winning.&nbsp; &nbsp;They&rsquo;ve lost sixteen times to teams that are better than they are.&nbsp; Ordinarily, inferior baseball teams win their share of games against superior opponents; right now it isn&rsquo;t happening.&nbsp; It feels like an inevitability, but one of probability rather than fate.&nbsp; Sooner or later a team is going to lose fifteen or twenty games; why not now?</p>
