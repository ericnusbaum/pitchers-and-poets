In this case, the following poem is constructed purely out of tweets from Jose Canseco's <a href="https://twitter.com/#!/JoseCanseco">twitter account</a>.</em></p>

<strong>Maybe I Am The Phantom of Baseball</strong></p>
<p>Maybe I am the phantom of baseball</p>
<p>I will do anything for one more at bat<br />
I know I can still hit MLB pitching<br />
I can still hit a golf ball 380 yards<br />
I have the hips of a 20 year old<br />
I can<br />
I have</p>
<p>I have a medical condition:<br />
I love the game so much<br />
Even in exhibition</p>
<p>Invite me for an old timers game<br />
I will play</p>
<p>Anything for a look</p>
<p>Still dreaming of that one last<br />
Trip of imagination<br />
Back to the big leagues</p>
<p>I miss everything where did it go</p>
