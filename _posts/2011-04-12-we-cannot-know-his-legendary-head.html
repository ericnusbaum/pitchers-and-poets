<p>I have written a poem about Manny Ramirez. It is a villanelle  in honor of National Poetry Month and in response to <a href="http://playfulutopia.com">Patrick DuBuque's</a> challenge to write a baseball villanelle. You may recognize the form from better poets like Dylan Thomas and Sylvia Plath.</p>
<blockquote><p>We cannot know his legendary head,<br />
We cannot know his riddle-speak, his swing,<br />
His heart that greets no consequence, no dread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Oblivious (or publicly misread),<br />
He went forth like a jester, like a king.<br />
We cannot know his legendary head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>Ramirez never anguished, never bled.<br />
Perfection seemed a right and simple thing.<br />
His heart? It greets no consequence, no dread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A paradox: collective joy and dread<br />
Awash in pride and drunk on estrogen--<br />
We cannot know his legendary head.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>A selfish man and insecure, they said.<br />
But maybe public shame can even sting<br />
A heart that greets no consequence, no dread.</p>
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p>And maybe all the jokes had turned to lead,<br />
The time had come to leave the center ring.<br />
We'll never know his legendary head,<br />
His heart that greets no consequence, no dread.</p></blockquote>
