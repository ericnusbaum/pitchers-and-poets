<p>Dear Spaghetti Arms,</p>
<p>I try not to engage in criticism. That is, I try to avoid using this blog as a platform to shout about why a certain player should bat in a certain place, or why Joe Scouting Director should be Fired Immediately. There are plenty of blogs for that, but we at Pitchers &amp; Poets pride ourselves on a different kind of thinking. We try to examine the game from both a greater distance and a much more intimate, immediate angle.</p>
<p>We&rsquo;re much inclined to gently criticize a point of view, or go off for a thousand words on some inane theory on fandom than make actual concrete predictions. Most of this is because Ted and I don&rsquo;t see baseball as just a collection of results. But another part of it, at least for me, is that I hate being proven wrong by insurmountable piles of data and cold hard facts.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/flying-spaghetti-monster.jpg"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-856" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/flying-spaghetti-monster.jpg" alt="flying spaghetti monster" width="378" height="378" /></a></p>
<p>So it&rsquo;s with a heavy heart that I apologize to you Jim Tracy. I not only questioned your hiring as manager of the Colorado Rockies, but berated the team&rsquo;s management for it. Here are some of the <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2009/05/29/welcome-back-spaghetti-arms/">silly things I wrote</a>:</p>
<p><em>In both Pittsburgh and Los Angeles, Jim Tracy was epically dull, notably un-dynamic, and completely void of compelling traits.</em></p>
<p>Okay that&rsquo;s still true.</p>
<p><em>Even on an interim level this might be the least inspired managerial hiring in the history of baseball.</em></p>
<p>Here are some statistics:</p>
<p>70-54 as of today</p>
<p>19-28 on May 29 when Clint Hurdle was fired.</p>
<p>51-26 since you, Jim Tracy, took over the club.</p>
<p>You can&rsquo;t see it, but I&rsquo;m actually looking away from the screen as I type this, so shamed I am by the numbers above.</p>
<p><em>It&rsquo;s not Jim Tracy&rsquo;s fault he&rsquo;s dull and ineffective and keeps getting hired. I&rsquo;m sure old Spaghetti-Arms is a nice enough guy and he certainly won&rsquo;t screw things up too badly.</em></p>
<p>If you discard my sarcastic, mocking tone, then this statement is actually accurate too.</p>
<p>Anyway, the point is I was wrong about you Jim Tracy. Your arms remain discomfortingly long and your gaze remains eerily unaffected, but you certainly have the capacity to manage a baseball team. As much as I&rsquo;d like to hold on with contemptuous pride to the words with which I described you (words like unsurprising, conventional, representative of a managerial stases in the MLB bloodstream, and retread), I must let them go. They were inaccurate and unjust and I have learned my lesson.</p>
<p>In the future, more esoteric, off-kilter, semi-obsessive posts on fandom, less pretending I actually know something about the inner workings of the Colorado Rockies. Alright,  Jim. May you win the Wild Card, but fall comfortably short of the Dodgers in the NL West Race.</p>
<p>Warmest Regards,</p>
<p>Eric</p>
