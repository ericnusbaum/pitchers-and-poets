  content: "What is Pitchers and Poets opinion on sending the president back into
    the stands to throw out the first pitch?\r\n\r\nFlip through SI's gallery and
    note the steady decline of dignity as presidents ditch their fedoras for a dad
    cap and an unworn mitt.\r\n\r\nhttp://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/multimedia/photo_gallery/1004/presidential.first.pitches/content.1.html"

  content: "Thanks for that link, Brad. I didn't realize that El Pres was throwing
    out the first pitch from the stands even up through the 80s, wow. \r\n\r\nMy first
    impression is that it's weird to throw a \"pitch\" from the stands. However, having
    seen Obama's chunk, it probably goes a long way to preserve the dignity of the
    highest office in the land."

  content: How difficult would it be to make these downloadable? I like listening
    to podcasts at work (don't worry, I'm allowed to).
