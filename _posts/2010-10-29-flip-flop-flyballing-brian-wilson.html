  content: Haha!  That's fantastic.  As a Rockies fan and therefore mandated Giant
    hater, I derive a strange pleasure from imagining Wilson as a cyclops.  Then again,
    maybe that's not strange... I have read the Odyssey, after all, and know what
    fate befalls cyclopses, or cyclopsi, or whatever.

<p>For Eric and me, we do what we do in the medium of words. Other people, like friend of the blog, friend of the podcast, and friend of humanity Craig Robinson, have a way with images (well, and words, really). If you aren't already tracking his <a title="Flip Flop Fly Ball Tumblr blog, Craig Robinson" href="http://flipflopflyball.tumblr.com/">Flip Flop Fly Ball Tumblr blog</a>, go ahead and do so.</p>
<p>One of Craig's latest illustrations (with a few words appended) says more than many millions of words across the web can:</p>
