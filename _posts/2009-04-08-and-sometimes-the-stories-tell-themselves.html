<p>Winton Silva, on the mound for San Diego as I type this, has the kind of history made for a movie. From <a href="http://www3.signonsandiego.com/stories/2009/apr/07/padres-notes-silva-dues-major-league-debut20347/?padres">Tom Krasovic in the SD Tribune</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Nine years ago, at age 23, Silva was a dishwasher at an Outback Steakhouse in Palm Desert and taking classes at the College of the Desert.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Four years ago, he pitched in a Sunday league near Los Angeles.</strong></p>
<p><strong>&ldquo;I needed the money,&rdquo; he said of his semi-pro days in Baldwin Park.</strong></p>
<p><strong>Tonight's gig?</strong></p>
<p><strong>A start against Manny Ramirez and the $96 million Los Angeles Dodgers. Silva, the No.&nbsp;3 starter for the Padres, will be making his major league debut.</strong></p></blockquote>
<p>It's not that I don't want the Dodgers to knock him around, it's just that I hope that his next start, against some less important team, is a successful one.</p>
<p>Also, who plays Winton Silva in the inevitable movie? I don't think Kevin Costner is really cut out for the role.</p>
