<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://weblogs.elearning.ubc.ca/ljohnson/archives/hugo-chavez-bat.jpg" alt="" width="120" height="161" />Another great thing about the World Baseball Classic: potential for awkward international political incident.</p>
<p>If you think the Obama administration calling out Rush Limbaugh and CNBC was bush league or unpresidential, get a load of Hugo Chavez. Chavez has now expressed his displeasure with some expat Venezuelans who booed Magglio Ordon at Saturday's WBC game against the Netherlands in Miami. Ordonez is a friend of the controversial Presidente/Generalisimo and did a commercial in support of Chavez before last month's term limits referendum. From the <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/worldclassic2009/news/story?id=3982112">AP story</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Chavez lamented that his friendship with Ordonez prompted catcalls from the mostly Venezuelan crowd during the team's 3-1 victory over the Netherlands in Miami on Saturday, saying the fans who booed the Detroit Tigers slugger "have no shame."</em></p>
<p><em>"Everyone has the right to think about politics," Chavez said after reading an article about the incident from The Associated Press. "This is shameful.</em></p>
<p><em>"Viva Magglio, and all our patriots!" Chavez added.</em></p>
<p><em>Ordonez, who went 0-for-3, said he felt "ashamed" by the way Venezuelans in the crowd reacted every time he stepped to the plate. Fans cheered loudly when he struck out in the fourth inning.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Magglio's children, <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Magglio_Ord%C3%B3%C3%B1ez#Nicknames_and_family">Magglio Jr. and Maggliana </a>had no comment.</p>
