<p>First, an opportunity to exercise your democratic power as citizens of the internet:</p>

<p>Paul Shirley, modern basketball's somewhat less entertaining version of Jim Bouton&nbsp; has a <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/thelife/news/story?id=4010308">post up at ESPN asking for votes</a> on which band's album he should review. I have absolutely no interest in reading a Paul Shirley music review, and his list has more than one band I like, but for the sake of P&amp;P solidarity, I beseech you to go vote for&nbsp; The Hold Steady. First off, they are inaugural members of the <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/?page_id=49">Baseball Mixtape</a> (click the discrete player in the bottom left corner of your screen). Second, <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V_SiHmAN6qs">they are really good</a>. Third, how I was introduced to them: My friend Yo Alex brought me to a free outdoor concert at which singer Craig Finn emerged for the encore stumbling drunk and wearing a Minnesota Twins jersey. He told an incoherent story about going fishing with his all time favorite player, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/h/hrbekke01.shtml">Kent Hrbek</a>, then explained that the jersey he was wearing was a game-worn Hrbek original. Then he drank some more, I think. Anyway, make sure you go vote.</p>
<p>Second, a baseball-math comic for your viewing pleasure:</p>
