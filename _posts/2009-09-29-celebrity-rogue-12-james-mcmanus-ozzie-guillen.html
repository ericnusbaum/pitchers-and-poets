<p><em>It might surprise you that the latest RBI term comes from writer Jim McManus, a devout White Sox fan, but its content is no shocker to the rest of us. This time out, McManus is preaching truth about some revisionist history.</em></p>
<h1><a href="http://newcenturypicnic.com/rbi/index.php?title=Ozzie_Guillen">Ozzie Guillen</a></h1>
<p><!-- start content -->A supposedly solid player and student of the game who was actually an inconsistent shortstop and banjo hitter with a big mouth--and an even bigger strike zone--during his once promising but ultimately forgettable career.</p>
<p><em>McManus is the author of numerous kick-ass books, including <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Positively-Fifth-Street-Murderers-Cheetahs/dp/0312422520/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_1">Positively Fifth Street</a> and <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Physical-American-Checkup-James-McManus/dp/0374232024">Physical: An American Checkup</a>. His latest, <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cowboys-Full-Story-James-McManus/dp/0374299242/ref=ntt_at_ep_dpt_2">Cowboys Full: The Story of Poker</a>, hits stores in late October.</em></p>
