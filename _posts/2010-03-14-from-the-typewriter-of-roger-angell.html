<p><em>Sometimes you come across a Roger Angell sentence that you can't help but share. This one comes from a mid-July, 1973 New Yorker magazine, in which he's describing a Yankees game he attended (the 'first' preceding this one was his first view of the designated hitter in action):</em></p>
<blockquote><p>The other true first, for me and perhaps for everyone there, was the moment in the eighth inning when Yankee catcher Thurman Munson and third baseman Graig Nettles, converging on a bunt by Jorge Orta, made simultaneous bare-handed grabs at the ball and came up holding hands.</p></blockquote>
