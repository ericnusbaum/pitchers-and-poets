<p>A nice little poem by <a href="http://www.stanford.edu/group/howiwrite/Bios/renatorosaldo/index.html">Renato Rosaldo</a> that hits on the ordinary/legendary theme I've been hitting on with this A-Rod stuff lately:</p>
<p>We celebrate their days,<br />
eat hot dogs, love baseball,<br />
but they say we were born to weed,<br />
change diapers, carry crates in the grey of dawn<br />
while they sleep. Awake, they look at us without seeing.</p>
<p>We see ourselves clearly, know ourselves<br />
precisely, without parades and picnics.<br />
To survive, we must.</p>
<p>I'm one of the invisible living among the notable.<br />
Day after day I hear doors shut,<br />
stumble over slurs, and bump into the man<br />
who nods yes, yes, but isn't listening.</p>
