<p>Somehow I ended up in a conversation with Carson Cistulli about home-run trot injuries, biblical misfortune, schlemiels, and schlemazels.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/tagg-youre-it-a-conversation-with-eric-nusbaum/">You can find it on Fangraphs.com.</a></p>
<p>And enjoy a brief excerpt here:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Carson:</strong> Eric, I know some things about you that the reader probably doesn&rsquo;t &mdash; namely, that (a) until yesterday, the first baseman on your fantasy baseball team was <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=3469&amp;position=DH/OF" target="_blank">Luke Scott</a>, that (b) Scott is no longer your first baseman because <a href="http://www.wezen-ball.com/tater-trot-tracker/tater-trot-tracker/luke-scott-pulls-a-hamstring-during-home-run-trot.html" target="_blank">he injured himself during a home trot last night</a>, and that (c) the only reason you had Luke Scott in the first place was as a replacement for <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=8610&amp;position=1B" target="_blank">Kendry Morales</a>, <em>who also hurt himself after hitting a home run</em>.</p>
<p>So, my hard-hitting question is: what the H, dude?</p>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong> You could say I have the luck of Job, or maybe of Tagg Bozied. If not that, then perhaps I am the one causing these injuries. Perhaps there is something haunted about my team &mdash; <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/statss.aspx?playerid=1679&amp;position=2B" target="_blank">Chase Utley</a> went down this week, too.</p>
<p><strong>Carson:</strong> I want to address the possibility of your superpowers momentarily, but first let&rsquo;s discuss Tagg Bozied. Bozied, in the event that the reader isn&rsquo;t familiar, is the outfielder who, in 2004, after hitting a walk-off grand slam to beat the Tacoma Rainiers, ruptured the patella tendon in his left knee while landing on home plate. In other words, it was a pretty similar injury to Morales&rsquo;s. The difference is that Bozied was only &mdash; what? &mdash; 23 or 24 at the time, was raking in Triple-A, and has never made it to the majors despite still being around.</p>
<p>Do you think that&rsquo;s the worst case scenario for a prospect? And also: what is it that&rsquo;s so &mdash; I don&rsquo;t know &mdash; tragic-seeming about Bozied&rsquo;s case?</p>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong> I don&rsquo;t know if it&rsquo;s the worst, but it has to be close. Bozied will always have the benefit of wondering what could have been. That has to be slightly better than never getting hurt, but also never being good enough. Or maybe it&rsquo;s not better &mdash; maybe knowing you had the ability to play in the majors but were denied the opportunity by chance, or Fortuna, or whatever causes these things to happen is more painful.</p></blockquote>
