  content: Great term, funny and accurate. This wouldn't be so tough if I didn't read
    everywhere what a nice guy Francoeur is. You wouldn't care if Barry Bonds kept
    not delivering; hell, I would have welcomed that. Francoeur is what he is, a guy
    who will occasionally do something that makes those who invested in him think
    he's ready to do it every day, but if he was going to figure that out, we'd have
    done it by now.

<p style="text-align: left;"><strong>Francoeurganda</strong> is a <a title="jeff francoeur rogue's baseball index" href="http://www.roguesbaseballindex.com/2011/03/30/francoeurganda/">Rogue's Baseball Index</a> term <a title="craig calcaterra hardball talk" href="http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/03/29/your-jeff-francoeur-apologist-quote-of-the-day/">coined by Craig Calcaterra</a> at <em><a title="hardball talk" href="http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/">Hardball Talk</a></em>, to refer to the annual Spring Training proclamations that on-base nightmare <a title="jeff francoeur" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/francje02.shtml">Jeff Francoeur </a>has been working on his plate discipline and will be a new hitter this year. As yet, this form of optimistic propaganda&nbsp;has not preceded measurable improvement in any of the years before which it was broadcast.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;">According to Calcaterra, "No matter how poorly [Francoeur] does, someone is going to say that this, by gum, is the year he breaks out.  No matter how little he progresses, Francoeur himself is going to say that he&rsquo;s working on his plate discipline.  You can set your watch by this alternate universe jive. And frankly, I&rsquo;d miss it if we didn&rsquo;t have it."</p>
