  content: 'Question:  Is there a no. 2 album in "Latin jazz?"'
---
<p>Fact:&nbsp; The no. 30 Smooth Jazz album on amazon.com is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Journey-Within-Bernie-Williams/dp/B00009VGX9">'The Journey Within' by Bernie Williams.</a> (Released in 2003)</p>
<p>Question: Is this because A.) Bernie Williams is famous, B.) Bernie Williams is actually a much better musician than you ever noticed, or C.) The only other artist in America willing to self-identify as&nbsp; a Smooth Jazz perform is Kenny G and he has only put out 29 albums?</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.fretbase.com/wp-content/uploads/2008/11/bernie-1.jpg" alt="" width="248" height="249" /></p>
<p>Much more startling fact: Bernie's new collection,<a href="http://www.amazon.com/Moving-Forward-Bernie-Williams/dp/B001QERPAW"> 'Moving Forward,' dropped April 14</a>. It features (no shit) a duet with Bruce Springsteen. As I type this, it's the no. 99 album on all of Amazon, and no. 1 in Latin Jazz. I wonder what, artistically, prompted Bernie to shift from smooth to Latin jazz. But I guess we can't really try and categorize or quantify artistic growth.</p>
<p>All 3&nbsp; (completely non-partisan and in no way Yankee fan) reviewers on Amazon have given 'Moving Forward' 5 stars. Dig the praise from user Brooklyn's Air Force:</p>
<blockquote><p>If you like guitar music, it's a base hit. It you like latin music, it's a double. If you like jazz, it's a triple. If you like listening to music that let's you sit back and relax or move your neck and feet it is an inside the park homerun. I purchased this one then went back and brought his first album. Springsteen was hard on my ears, but he is the boss. Williams is a very talented musician!</p></blockquote>
<p>Gee, I hope to hell he's overstating it! If we are really living in a world where The Boss is 'hard on the ears' compared to Bernie Williams, I have a great deal of painful soul-searching to do.</p>
