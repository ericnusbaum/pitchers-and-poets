  content: I can't believe you gave Chan Ho a shout out. I would enjoy hearing how
    he spent the $60 million (!) the Rangers paid him for 22 W's.

<p>Transcript, if you don't speak robot:</p>
<p><strong>Ted: </strong> Well, Eric, it is now baseball's offseason. Are you ready for the Hot Stove season?</p>
<p><strong>Eric: </strong>To be honest, no.&nbsp; I am not ready. I am still in a state of World Series  hangover. But I am using this time to rethink my approach to the  offseason, to consider how one best enjoys the rumor mill. I'm asking  myself, is hanging onto every last Jon Heyman eyebrow flicker, Ken Rosenthal bow tie tug, unsourced tweet, a rewarding and self-realizing  process?</p>
<p><strong>Ted: </strong> On the contrary, I'm excited to focus all my attention on Cliff Lee as he rocks away in his rocking chair on the outskirts of some Arkansas town, evading questions about the Nationals while he caresses the pelt of his latest kill. Who needs the metropolitan world centers, with all of their commerce and noise pollution, when you can track Jon High man as he searches for a Wi Fi connection. But seriously, a world series hangover is a good thing. I was amazed how quickly the news cycle turns to free agents. I mean, Brian Wilson's beard hasn't even dried out yet.</p>
<p><strong>Eric: </strong>Are you? I think instead of watching Cliff Lee's every movement this  offseason, I am going to strive for something even more ambitious: I  want to embody Cliff Lee. I want to go at the offseason with an easy  precision and chill attitude he demonstrates on the mound; I want to act  as though nothing matters a wit even though deep in my heart,  somewhere, I know the stakes are high. Or to use a baseball cliche, I  want to let the game come to me. Speaking of baseball cliches, how about  that Joe Morgan?</p>
<p><strong>Ted: </strong>Joe Morgan is  proud of your hard-nosed approach to the offseason. That's how he will  approach his recently elevated role in meal preparation at the old  homestead. If he doesn't show up on TV somewhere, I admit I will miss  him, the way I miss Full House after school: it wasn't good, but it was  there. Who is this Hersh hizer fellow, anyway?</p>
<p><strong>Eric: </strong>Ten ex-Dodger pitchers I would rather listen on Sunday Night Baseball  than Orel Hershiser: Tom Candiotti, Eric Gagne, Pedro Martinez, Ramon  Martinez, Chan Ho Park, Scott Radinsky, John Wetteland, Mike Fetters,  Hoyt Wilhelm, and of course Fernando Valenzuela.</p>
