<p><em>One thing we're interested in here at Pitchers &amp; Poets is the space where baseball interacts with, well, everything else in our world. Starting now, and then through the off-season, we'll speak with folks who's day jobs aren't baseball-related but are in one way or another notable, about the old national pastime.<br />
</em></p>
<p>Our first interviewee is singer songwriter <a href="http://jasonisbell.com">Jason Isbell</a>, formerly a Drive-By Trucker, currently leader of his rocking band the 400 Unit. He's from the Muscle Shoals region of Alabama, and a huge Atlanta Braves fan.&nbsp; Next month he hits the road headlining the first ever <a href="http://www.pastemagazine.com/articles/2010/08/first-ever-paste-tour-ready-to-knock-yer-dorky-soc.html">Paste Magazine tour</a>, along with Langhorne Slim, Jesse Sykes, and more.</p>
<p>We'll get right to it:</p>
<p><strong>PnP:</strong> Leadbelly once said that all songs, in the end, are about baseball. With that in mind, have you written any songs about baseball?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Isbell: </strong>I've attempted to do so, but it's not something I've felt success  with just yet. &nbsp;I actually discussed doing a concept record about baseball  with Will Johnson (Centro-Matic, Monsters of Folk) at one point, but I don't  know if he realized I was serious. &nbsp;He's an expert on the game, by the  way.</p>
<p><strong>PnP: </strong> Do you have a favorite actually about baseball song?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Isbell:</strong> I love the poem about the mighty Casey, but I guess that doesn't  qualify as a song. &nbsp;I always liked the theme song to "Talkin' Baseball,"  the show they played after This Week In Baseball when there was an extra long rain-delay.  &nbsp;Campanella is a really lyrical name.</p>
<p><strong>PnP:</strong> How did you become a baseball fan? A Braves fan, specifically?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Isbell: </strong>I played ball starting when I was 6, so I followed it then.  &nbsp;I guess my Dad was initially responsible. &nbsp;My grandparents on Dad's  side were very religious -my granddad had been a Pentecostal preacher- so there  wasn't much they could look to for non-offensive family entertainment.  &nbsp;Because I played ball, my grandparents started watching the Braves on TBS,  and they wound up getting a lot of joy out of those games. &nbsp;As I got a  little older, I realized how much they valued the afternoons and evenings we  spent together watching Braves baseball, and that made the team mean something  very special to me. &nbsp;I wish they were still around to watch Bobby's last  season.</p>
<p><strong>PnP: </strong>Are you worried about the Braves in a post-Cox, post-Chipper Jones era? Or are you confident in the future of the Jason Heyward Braves?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Isbell: </strong>I loved them in the Gerald Perry, Dale Murphy days, and I'll love  'em if they lose again. &nbsp;However, I think they have a lot of strength in  younger players like Heyward, Prado, and Infante, so they should be fine.</p>
<p><strong>PnP: </strong> I grew up watching a lot of Braves baseball on TBS and found the Carey/Sutton broadcast team almost impossibly boring. What do you look for in a baseball broadcast?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Isbell: </strong>I like the unexpected. &nbsp;I think the guys on Sports South do  a good job, because they aren't always so serious. &nbsp;They make some really  silly comments and crack themselves up fairly often.</p>
<p><strong>PnP: </strong><a href="http://twitter.com/jasonisbell">Twitter seems to be your biggest outlet</a> when it comes to expressing Braves fandom. Have you connected much with other fans or baseball press or even Braves players?</p>
<p><strong>Jason Isbell: </strong>I've spoken to <a href="http://blogs.ajc.com/atlanta-braves-blog/">Dave O'Brien at the AJC</a> quite a bit, and there are  lots of Braves fans who also follow my music, so it's nice to keep in contact  with them when I can. &nbsp;Still trying to start a conversation with the Braves  organist, because he's absolutely hilarious.</p>
<p><strong>PnP: </strong> How do being a baseball fan and a musician reconcile? Do you sense any of that high school strain between the rockers and the jocks, or conversely do you see the two as having a beneficial relationship.</p>
<p><strong>Jason Isbell:</strong> I was not at all a jock in high school, but I know a lot of  musicians who were. &nbsp;I think we can all get along, especially since  baseball is a thinking man's game. &nbsp;I also feel it's not a sport that's  only accessible to the relatively wealthy, like golf, so that made it easier for  me to get interested. &nbsp; I would've never been able to afford to play golf  as a kid, but you can always find an open field and a stick.</p>
<p><em>Since we recently discussed American Mythology including the subject of this particular tune, here's a video of Jason playing his song "The Day John Henry Died" acoustic. Thanks to Jason for his time.<br />
