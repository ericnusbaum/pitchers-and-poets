<ul>
<li>Rick Soisson offers <a href="http://thebaseballchronicle.com/essays/the_greatest_hitter_of_all_time">an alternative vision</a> of the eternal question at The Baseball Chronicle: who is the best hitter of all time?</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Keith Olbermann <a href="http://keitholbermann.mlblogs.com/archives/2009/08/the_greatest_cooperstown_find.html">explores the form</a> of another baseball great: Christy Mathewson, who pitched in a time before film.</li>

Kind of a Dennis Eckersley sidewinder thing going on there. via <a href="http://eastwindupchronicle.com/perfect-swing-forever/">East Windup Chronicle</a></li>
