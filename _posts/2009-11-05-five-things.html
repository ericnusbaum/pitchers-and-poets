  content: I take back every negative thing I've said about the RBI, well, the only
    negative thing I've said about the RBI. I think it's great, and the more familiar
    I've become with PnP, the more I appreciate it as a separate, but linked to, entity.
    Kudos all around. Keep up the good work.

<p>I.</p>
<p>I had the chance to wander around outside of Yankee Stadium for an hour or so before Game Six. I&rsquo;ll use clich&eacute;s to describe the atmosphere: you could cut the tension with a knife, the air was electric (the crowd was buzzing), hearts were aflutter, and a lot of people were drunk.</p>
<p>II.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what pisses my friend <a href="http://steveweddle.com">Steve</a> off: &ldquo;For the past ten years, people have been saying that the Yankees have proven how money can&rsquo;t buy a World Series. Today they say that the Yankees' winning just proves you can buy a World Series.&rdquo;</p>
<p>III.</p>
<p>There were a lot of solitary men around River Ave. looking for individual tickets to last night&rsquo;s game. They had signs, mostly, and stood apart from the usual scalper crowd. From the desperation in their middle-aged eyes, you might have guessed that the Yankees had never ever won a World Series before.</p>
<p>IV.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s what Ted thinks about the Yankees' winning: &ldquo;In the end, the Yankees' winning again signals a sort of return to normalcy, for better or worse.  It&rsquo;s like John Wayne regaining control of the ranch away from the raggedy outsiders.&rdquo;  Or a white, Protestant, male regaining the White House. Zing.</p>
<p>V.</p>
<p>Not enough people have taken the time to mock the whole &ldquo;Win one for the Boss&rdquo; theme. They were even selling officially licensed tee shirts outside the stadium with said motto. Has George Steinbrenner really had it so bad? Did he recently become &ndash; somehow &ndash; a sympathetic figure? Will this 27th ring be the one that finally allows the old codger to take a deep, satisfied puff on his cigar, tell himself &ldquo;my life&rsquo;s work is now complete&rdquo; and then go gently into the Tampa night?</p>
