<p>Short little poem this week by <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Mrs-Goose-Goes-Washington-Political/dp/1416538062/ref=sr_1_7?ie=UTF8&amp;s=books&amp;qid=1209994451&amp;sr=8-7,">Hart Seely</a> and a link to a website from which it came: <a href="http://bardball.com">Bardball</a>, whose mission is&nbsp; "reviving the art of baseball doggerel."</p>
<p><a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=clagge001ant">Anthony Claggett</a>,<br />
Your fastball, they flag it.<br />
It floats like a maggot,<br />
They wait there and tag it.<br />
Throw harder, or bag it.<br />
Anthony Claggett.</p>
<p>Anthony Claggett,<br />
We&rsquo;ll rip you in agate,<br />
Your body, we&rsquo;ll drag it.<br />
Meet quim, you best shag it.<br />
Or, otherwise, bag it.<br />
Anthony Claggett.</p>
<p>Take the time to explore Bardball, it's worth more than just a passing look. Seely is worth more than just a passing look too --he's responsible for the fantastic <a href="http://www.google.com/url?sa=t&source=web&ct=res&cd=2&url=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.slate.com%2Fid%2F2201342%2F&ei=5mL3SamvG8-rtgfxioyvDw&usg=AFQjCNEbsCKVZtZImKeTF0tmgmybxzzWMw">Poetry of Sarah Palin</a> piece from Slate last election season.</p>
