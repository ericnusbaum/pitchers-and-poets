  content: I've been a Ken Levine fan since he broadcast Orioles games about 20years
    ago with Jon Miller. Read his blog every day. Nice assignment to get, and well
    done.

In all the Opening Day hysteria and marathon liveblogging (my eyes still hurt), I failed to properly note that I wrote a couple of things elsewhere this week. Sorry if you've already seen these on Twitter:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://freedarko.blogspot.com/2011/03/you-see-what-you-see_31.html">You See What You See:</a></strong> An essay for FreeDarko about Nick Van Exel, Showtime, and my young basketball fandom. There's even a Raul Mondesi reference for those of you not into hoops.</p>
<p><a href="http://www.seattleweekly.com/2011-03-30/news/hails-from-hollywood/"><strong>Hails From Hollywood:</strong></a> An article for Seattle Weekly on Ken Levine, television writer and Mariners broadcaster and all-around hilarious mensch.</p>
