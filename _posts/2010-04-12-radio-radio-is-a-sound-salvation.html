  content: I have Bill James disease a little, but it really does depend on who's
    saying it. I'd trust Peter Gammons a little more than say, Ralph Kiner. Sports
    radio....again, depends who's saying it. Costas, ok, maybe I believe him...he
    has a great memory. Screamy McInsult guy who seems to populate a lot of radio
    shows....not so much.

  content: Context is a big part of it, absolutely Paul. If Dave Cameron is saying
    it on the Fangraphs podcast, then yes Bill James Disease is mitigated extremely.

  content: "I think the reason for it is that with the explosion of sports blogs,
    there are so many better, more informed choices. When you are a multi-sports columnist
    or radio host you just can't know as much about each individual sport. With the
    internet and blogs, you have obsessive fans pour over ever stat - past, present
    and future - and are just way more knowledgeable and can provide way more actual
    insight than analysis than the usual ESPN tropes and cliches. You as an author
    and a reader of a blog yourself have exposed yourself to a much higher quality
    of sports analysis that the usual stuff just does not cut the mustard anymore.
    If that gives me Bill James disease, I won't be looking for a cure. \r\n\r\nAlso,
    Kelly Dwyer of Ball Don't Lie has spoken on this subject much more eloquently
    than I. http://sports.yahoo.com/nba/blog/ball_dont_lie/post/Kindly-ignore-the-Colin-Cowherds?urn=nba,230837"

  content: "You make great points, Alex, and I think that article makes some good
    points as well. Here's what I think the \"solution\" is, though I don't really
    believe in solutions, per se: radio as an art form.\r\n\r\nThere's a lot lot lot
    to be said for the art of speech. Spoken language is engaging, calming, enjoyable,
    community-building, etc. It's great. I love talk radio. We've established that
    these guys can't keep up in terms of information and specifics. Therefore, they
    shouldn't try. They should move away from the proclamations and focus more on
    stories, on perception, on community, on fun. Boers and Bernstein are hilarious,
    ie. they are a comedy show about sports, and they tap into the community's sentiments
    about sports. \r\n\r\nThat in my mind is the future of the generalist, as it is
    for sports magazines."

<p><em>This was originally posted over at <a href="http://everydayichiro.blogspot.com/2010/04/radio-radio-is-sound-salvation.html">Every Day Ichiro</a>, which chronicles my new turn as a Mariners fan, and as an AL fan in general.</em></p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">SPORTS TALK RADIO AND A CITY'S IDENTITY</span></p>
<p>Part of being a fan is listening to local sports radio. I am even right now listening to 710 AM KIRO Seattle.</p>
<p>I love sports talk radio (it being a subset of talk radio, which I also love, in the way that you love something that remained a part of your life as you moved from child to adult). In Chicago and in New England, a better part of those regions' broad character came through in the personae of the sports talk radio hosts. The pride and the humor from 670AM in Chicago's <a href="http://www.670thescore.com/pages/3578055.php">Boers and Bernstein</a>--still the funniest radio I've ever heard--and the acerbic self-flagellation of the pre-World Series Boston guys whoever they were. I link these indelibly with my experience living in these places. Deep truths emerge from hours, days and weeks of listening.</p>
<p>Here in the Pacific Northwest, I am still collecting this metaphysical data. I don't yet have a bead on the psyche of this place. What I think I know so far is that Mariners fans have been through years of hard  times and inept management under Bill Bavasi. Now, with Jack Z and his flurry of  handyman-style moves and his several big moves, they are optimistic bunch.</p>
<p>What I also think I know is that these fans are <span style="font-style: italic;">analytical</span>. On 710 this morning, I already heard one caller who discussed the manner in which the team is meant to win. They aren't meant to hit, he said, they're meant to have great pitching and great defense. In other words, the problem isn't that the Ms aren't scoring enough runs, it's that they're aren't preventing enough runs. That's heavy, and it shows a lot of a) patience and b) smarts on the part of the fans. There's a method, here, and Ms fans are willing to give over the fate of  their fandom to that method.</p>
<p>In the meantime, worry is setting in on the radio. Brock and Salk are wondering if it's too soon, or if it's too late, or if it's up or it's down. Don Wakamatsu has let loose a couple of sound clips, saying things like "feeding off of one another" and "guys are pressing right now." These are the misgivings of a tortured fan base that is afraid of its own optimism. "Let's not everybody freak out yet," the <a href="http://www.ussmariner.com/2010/04/08/for-comparison/">blogs</a> are <a href="http://www.lookoutlanding.com/2010/4/8/1412030/1-3-game-thoughts">saying</a>. The more calls for calm, the more unnerved the hoi polloi becomes, I think.</p>
<p><span style="font-style: italic;">BILL JAMES DISEASE</span></p>
<p>The new modern problem with sports talk radio is what I might call Bill James disease, in which one must second guess every assertion by the mainstream media members who are speaking for the most part off the top of their heads. To wit: Salk said something like "Ichiro will see a lot of pitches because of all of the foul balls." Now, this might be true, I don't know. I tried to check on <a href="http://fangraphs.com/">Fangraphs</a> without much success. But the point is, I don't really believe it when Mike Salk says it. Not because I don't trust the guy, but because I don't think he's committed his life to having command of these facts and figures. Hell, I wouldn't trust <span style="font-style: italic;">myself</span> if I said that, no way.</p>
<p>Once I start to pay attention to these passing assertions, they appear everywhere in sports talk radio. Each remark--blinks of an eye in the hours and hours of radio talk time--could warrant ten spreadsheets and a panel of experts to suss it out. Do I need to know if it's true or not? Why can't I treat the radio like it's a conversation with a friend, meaning imbued with trust, forgiveness and merriment? Because I've got Bill James Disease, that's why.</p>
