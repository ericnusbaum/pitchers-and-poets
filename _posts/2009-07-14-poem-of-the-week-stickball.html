<p>This week's poem (h/t <a href="http://wiedemar.wordpress.com/">Reeves</a> -- please click that link) meanders across a suffocating New York afternoon. We're in the 40s or 50s in a working class neighborhood and the weather is scorching -- I mean it's <a href="http://www.filmreference.com/images/sjff_01_img0141.jpg">Do The Right Thing</a> hot outside. You'll feel it in a second when you read the thing. Any poem that uses "bleachered" as a verb is alright with me, and this one, written by <a href="http://chucksullivanpoet.com">Chuck Sullivan</a> and first published in Esquire,&nbsp; sure does:</p>
<blockquote><p>In the middle<a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/poets_chuck-sullivan-baseball-card.jpg"><img src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/poets_chuck-sullivan-baseball-card.jpg" alt="poets_chuck sullivan baseball card" title="poets_chuck sullivan baseball card" width="300" height="420" class="alignright size-full wp-image-649" /></a><br />
of the concrete heat<br />
boys manning our<br />
sneakered positions tarred<br />
in the block's summer field</p>
<p>We hustled out<br />
fates into shape<br />
on the city's sweating face<br />
in the lean, bouncing grace<br />
of our broomstick, rubber ball game<br />
bound by the sewers and parked cars<br />
of our Outlaw Little League</p>
<p>While on the sidelines<br />
dreaming in our cheers<br />
the old men watched<br />
bleachered on brownstone stoops<br />
and iron fire escapes<br />
making small book on the shadowy<br />
skills of stickball stars<br />
lost in the late-inning sun<br />
of the stadiumed street's<br />
priceless, makeshift diamond</p></blockquote>
