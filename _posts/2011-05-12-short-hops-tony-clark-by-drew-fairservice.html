<p><em>Drew Fairservice, a <a href="http://walkoffwalk.com">Walkoff Walk</a> veteran, blogs about the Blue Jays at the recently (and beautifully) redesigned <a href="http://ghostrunneronfirst.com">Ghostrunner on First</a> and other teams at <a href="http://blogs.thescore.com/mlb/">The Score</a>. </em></p>
<p><strong>Tony Clark</strong> is the most 90s first basemen of all time.</p>
<p>He could switch hit. He owned a solid (albeit no-brainer) nickname. He hit home runs onto Trumbull Avenue. He was a bad fielder. He was athletic enough to play college basketball. He got hurt. He went away. Then he came back! Then he went on TV.</p>
