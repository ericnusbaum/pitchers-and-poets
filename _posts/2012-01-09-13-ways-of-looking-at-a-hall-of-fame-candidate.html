  content: Beautifully done, Ted. I'm surprised that Edgar ordered dinner so loudly,
    he is such a soft-spoken man.

  content: Brilliant. As a modernist &amp; baseball fan, I loved it. Is sport better
    suited for poetry &amp; the radio?

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-4583" title="auden" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2012/01/auden.png" alt="w.h. auden" width="600" height="363" />Since our blog is, after all, called Pitchers &amp; Poets, we thought we would subject a few of this year&rsquo;s Hall of Fame candidates to the imaginary scrutiny of both a pitcher and a poet of our choosing. Below, see the Hall of Fame analysis of a professional pitcher, and the response from a prominent poet, as you await the final ruling:</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jeff Bagwell</span></p>
<p>Cardinals hurler and freelance groundskeeper Jim Otten: "Unless steroids make goatees grow faster, you can&rsquo;t prove anything."</p>
<p>Poet WH Auden: &ldquo;Now he is scattered among a hundred cities, and wholly given over to unfamiliar affections to find his happiness in another kind of wood.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Barry Larkin</span></p>
<p>Reno Silver Sox hurler <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=ginsbe001nat">Nathan Ginsberg</a>: &ldquo;One of the best hitting and fielding shortstops of his generation. Writers, you know what to do.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poet Allen Ginsberg: &ldquo;When will you be angelic? When will you take off your clothes? When will you look at yourself through the grave? When will you be worthy of your million Christs?&rdquo;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Bernie Williams</span></p>
<p>California Angels farmhand <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=sylvia001ron">Ronald Sylvia</a>: &ldquo;Probably not Hall-worthy, but he had a great career.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poet Sylvia Plath: &ldquo;His head is a little interior of grey mirrors. Each gesture flees immediately down an alley of diminishing perspectives, and its significance drains like water out the hole at the far end.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Jack Morris</span></p>
<p>Old timey Pittsburgh Allegheny <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/morried01.shtml">Ed &ldquo;Cannonball&rdquo; Morris</a>: &ldquo;Heckuva competitor, good lifetime numbers, and a fine face-whisker set. Probably deserves a shot at immortality.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poet Robert Lowell: &ldquo;He has an angry wrenlike vigilance, a greyhound's gentle tautness; he seems to wince at pleasure, and suffocate for privacy.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Edgar Martinez</span></p>
<p>67th round draft pick for the Houston Astros in 1996 <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/minors/player.cgi?id=keats-000ben">Ben Keats</a>: &ldquo;I have never met Edgar Martinez, but I once saw him order dinner from across the restaurant.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poet John Keats: &ldquo;He hath heard the Lion's roaring, and can tell what his horny throat expresseth.&rdquo;</p>
<p><span style="text-decoration: underline;">Tim Raines</span></p>
<p>Early 80s California Angels starter <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/f/frostda01.shtml">Dave Frost</a>: &ldquo;Rock has been overlooked for way too long.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Poet Robert Frost: &ldquo;He is all pine and I am apple orchard.&rdquo;</p>
