<p style="text-align: justify;">From&nbsp; <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2010/04/02/pnp-podcast-episode-iv-a-new-hope/">Episode IV of the PnP Podcast ("A New Hope")</a> published April 2, 2010:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Eric:</strong> I think the Texas Rangers will win the AL West.</p>
<p><strong>Ted:</strong> I think that&rsquo;s a bold pick, I think that&rsquo;s a fun pick, I think that&rsquo;s an American pick.</p></blockquote>
<p>I am as of yet unsure of Ted's rooting allegiance in this World Series. He is obviously quite smitten by Pat Burrell. But for the record, I'm Rangers all the way. Antlers.</p>
