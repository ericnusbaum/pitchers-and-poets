<p><em>Ember Nickel of the often e-less <a href="http://lipogramscorecard.wordpress.com/">Lipogram! Scorecard!</a> offers up the latest Celebrity Rogue contribution to the swelling cavity of hardball knowledge that is the <a href="http://roguesbaseballindex.com">Rogue's Baseball Index</a>. On tap, there's the basic delusion of old school broadcasters, and a melancholy marker of a favorite done moved on.</em></p>
<h1 id="firstHeading"><a href="http://newcenturypicnic.com/rbi/index.php?title=Keeping_Score_at_Home">Keeping Score at Home</a></h1>
<p><!-- start content --><strong>Keeping Score at Home</strong> consists of, while at home, filling out a scorecard to keep track of a game being watched on TV or, more romantically, listened to on the radio. In the days before pitch-by-pitch updates online or through cell phones, this might have been an eminently worthwhile undertaking. Nowadays, the belief that some people might be <strong>Keeping Score at Home</strong> propels radio announcers to repeat themselves, sometimes by using numbers to represent fielders in a way that lends a smug sense of superiority to a small group of listeners. This all takes place despite any evidence that anyone is actually <strong>Keeping Score at Home</strong>.</p>
<h1 id="firstHeading"><a href="http://newcenturypicnic.com/rbi/index.php?title=The_One_That_Got_Away">The One That Got Away</a></h1>
<p><!-- start content --><strong>The One That Got Away</strong> is the player whose career with one single team spans, if not multiple decades, the early years of your childhood fandom. After he is past his peak and/or your market is too small for his salary, he is traded for several prospects or goes unsigned by a general manager whose shrewd sabermetric knowledge far exceeds yours. When <strong>The One That Got Away</strong> gets away, it causes you to resent said general manager with a child's self-righteousness for years, when you could have been doing more productive things.</p>
<p><em>Stay tuned for more tales of baseball madness and sorrow, as our Celebrity Rogue week continues...</em></p>
