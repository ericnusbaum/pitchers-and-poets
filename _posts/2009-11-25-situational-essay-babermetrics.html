<p><em>When we recruited <a href="http://epiloguemagazine.com">Epilogue Magazine </a>editor Corban Goble to contribute a term to the Rogue's Baseball Index, we didn't know it would lead to this.&nbsp; That term, </em><em><a href="http://newcenturypicnic.com/rbi/index.php?title=Babermetrics">Babermetrics</a>, has become a full-blown science. Here's Corban's overview.<br />
</em></p>
<p>In 2003, the innovations outlined in Michael Lewis&rsquo;s Moneyball brought deep statistical analysis to Major League Baseball&rsquo;s front offices and to the mainstream. However, baseball&rsquo;s statistical awakening strangely hasn&rsquo;t trickled down to the world of hooking up, a world still framed in the antiquated slang of base-counting.</p>
<p>I propose a new science, Babermetrics (from baseball&rsquo;s &ldquo;sabermetrics&rdquo;) that can more truly capture the multifaceted and complex experience of hooking up.</p>
<p>Some sample Babermetrics statistics:</p>
<p>BRI&mdash;Babes Reeled In, a rather conventional measurement that tallies the number of sexual encounters, quite similar to baseball&rsquo;s RBI (Runs Batted In) statistic. BRI is a statistic that doesn&rsquo;t truly account for consistency or performance, but should be noted for its raw counting value.<br />
Hypothetical Example: Wilt Chamberlain has the highest-known career BRI total, claiming over 10,000 sexual encounters over his lifetime.</p>
<p>Used in a Sentence: &ldquo;Last year, Sal&rsquo;s BRI was the lowest total of his career. Leaving college is a likely factor as well as the accumulation of a gratuitous beer gut and residence in his parent&rsquo;s basement.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2008/images/05/16/chamberlain_clicks.jpg" alt="" width="460" height="297" /></p>
<p>Bar Factor&mdash;like sabermetrics&rsquo; &ldquo;park factor,&rdquo; a statistical device use to measure the impact of a particular stadium&rsquo;s characteristics on performance, Bar Factor is an effective statistic that measures performance at a certain venue relative to another.<br />
Hypothetical Example: College is the ultimate example of the Bar Factor; it&rsquo;s a realm maintaining a distinct set of characteristics uniquely tailored to hooking up.<br />
Used in a Sentence: &ldquo;Janet, I don&rsquo;t think I&rsquo;m going to go to library fundraiser tonight. The Bar Factor simply isn&rsquo;t high enough; I&rsquo;m going to O&rsquo;Halligans!&rdquo;</p>
<p>VORB&mdash;Value Over Replacement-level Barfly. Akin to Kevin Woolner&rsquo;s VORP (Value Over Replacement-level player), VORB measures the relative value of a particular mate in relationship to the value of an average (or replacement-level) hook up.<br />
Hypothetical Example: The majority of the student population at any Northeastern-region private college will likely hover right around replacement level, where the average VORB in NYC&rsquo;s Meatpacking District remains very high due to the high concentration of patrons who work as models.<br />
Used in a Sentence: &ldquo;Winslow, the VORB at this nightclub is way too high for me to even talk to anybody without getting a drink splashed in my face. I&rsquo;m going to O&rsquo;Halligans!&rdquo;</p>
<p>OPS&mdash;Opportunities Plus Sexual encounters, a clean interpretation of sabermetrics&rsquo; OPS (On-Base Plus Slugging), a statistic used to evaluate the overall effectiveness of a given player&rsquo;s offensive production. In Babermetrics, a tool used to provide an accurate approximation of sexual effectiveness, combining both &ldquo;opportunities&rdquo; (first base and above, as defined in the Babermetrics Almanac) with total number of sexual encounters.<br />
Hypothetical Example: As in baseball, the man or woman with the highest OPS is likely the most productive performer.<br />
Used in a Sentence: &ldquo;Tucker Max, due to your sizeable dip in OPS, our publishing company no longer sees you as a credible literary voice, despite the preposterous embellishment of your stories.&rdquo;</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://www.hotchickswithdouchebags.com/uploaded_images/AceyDouchey-787004.jpg" alt="" width="475" height="300" /></p>
<p>Though I&rsquo;ve decided to pull out some statistics that best illustrate the need for a revolution in the statistical analysis of hooking up, it should be mentioned that there are numerous other structural similarities between baseball and sex that have long gone unrecognized.</p>
<p>For instance, in college baseball, the NCAA allows the hitters to use aluminum bats; it&rsquo;s hard not to get a hit, and it&rsquo;s an unrealistic representation of baseball&rsquo;s professional world, where MLB mandates that hitters use the heavier, power-dampening wooden bats. Such an analogy is rather pliant to the departure from the unrealistic bubble of college and joining the population at large.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s a notable difference between the world of baseball and the world of hooking up&mdash;hooking up doesn&rsquo;t have an offseason.</p>
<p>As the calendar crawls toward another baseball season&rsquo;s conclusion, America&rsquo;s singles will still be wearing slutty bee costumes for Halloween, sidling up to the previously unapproachable co-ed from the Creative Department at the office Christmas Party, still playing &ldquo;empty the Solo cup&rdquo; at football tailgates for respective alma maters.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s time to fill a void. Welcome to the playground of new science.</p>
