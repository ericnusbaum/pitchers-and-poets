  content: Def. adding Sontag's book to a list of things I need to read. Good article.

<p>It&rsquo;s often the case that sportswriters are in the business of creating metaphors.&nbsp; Certainly, there&rsquo;s plenty of work to be done with regards to reporting the day&rsquo;s events, at least until the <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/not/index.php/sportswriting-sort-of/">robots take over</a>.&nbsp; But eventually, given the cyclical nature of sports, writers are tasked with making those events <em>mean</em> something.&nbsp; In the old days, this was done by converting athletes into avatars, heroic young men who represented their adopted hometowns, and whose accomplishments on the field added to the local lore.&nbsp; Recently, those familial bonds have weakened, and writers have been forced to become more creative in their meaning-making.</p>
<p>One element of baseball nearly untouched by this narrative shift is the injury.&nbsp; The tale of Kerry Wood isn&rsquo;t much different than that of Gary Nolan, at its roots. Injuries are a part of the game, and yet they feel somehow unnatural, defacing what should be a predictable career arc.&nbsp; They can destroy the best intentions of the craftiest of general managers, or reduce a star player to a cheerleader.</p>
<p><a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/11/17/injury-as-metaphor/ss1/" rel="attachment wp-att-4400"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-4400" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/ss1-203x300.jpg" alt="" width="203" height="300" /></a>What&rsquo;s fascinating about injuries is that they&rsquo;re a symbol for both strength and weakness, a duality, &ldquo;like all really successful metaphors,&rdquo; as Susan Sontag wrote in her 1977 work&nbsp;<span style="text-decoration: underline">Illness as Metaphor</span>.&nbsp; Sontag devoted her attention to the disparate legacies of the great diseases of the nineteenth and twentieth centuries: tuberculosis and cancer.&nbsp; As she declares in her introduction, &ldquo;illness is <em>not</em> a metaphor, and that the most truthful way of regarding illness &ndash; and the healthiest way of being ill &ndash; is one most purified of, most resistant to, metaphoric thinking&rdquo;.&nbsp; In baseball &ndash; and I understand the dangers of using the same metaphoric instinct in connecting the two &ndash; injury is much like illness, treated as something more than itself.</p>
<p>Much as disease is the harbinger of old age and inevitable death, injury is a failure of the body.&nbsp; And yet, there is glory in injury.&nbsp; The annals of baseball history are filled with men who overcame their injuries and their pain: Schilling bleeding into his sock, Gibson limping around the basepaths.&nbsp; The player who fights through his pain is treated as heroic; masculinity demands that they ignore and even hide their injuries, even to the detriment of their own team.&nbsp; There is no duplicity in this; each player is convinced that no injury can stop him, just as he must convince himself that every slump is about to end.&nbsp; Much like cancer patients who are shielded from the realities of their illness by well-meaning doctors, the first cure for any disease, as with any injury, is positive thinking.&nbsp; &ldquo;A happy man won&rsquo;t get the plague&rdquo;, goes the proverb, but the dangerous subtext to this philosophy is that those who do suffer must share at least some of the responsibility.</p>
<p><a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/11/17/injury-as-metaphor/cs1-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-4438"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4438" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/cs11.jpg" alt="" width="200" height="200" /></a>The key to the glory of injury is that it must be painful without being debilitating.&nbsp; Perhaps this is why, with the exception of Schilling&rsquo;s sock and a few other rare examples, the glorious injuries always belong to the hitters.&nbsp; The hitter complains of his hamstrings, breaks an unidentifiable bone in his wrist, and still manages to make the violent, split-second swing that brings victory.&nbsp; Pitchers have no such luck.&nbsp; Like cancer, the pitcher&rsquo;s ailment is unseen, insidious, terrifying.&nbsp; A man can be perfectly happy and healthy, wielding pinpoint mechanics, and a single pop in the elbow or shoulder can end it immediately.&nbsp; Such occurrences are the natural target for dread, and the player is quickly shuttled away, exiled from his former family, to the wasteland of rehab and extended spring training.&nbsp; His life, the camaraderie and routine so carefully fashioned, is torn away in ragged fashion.</p>
<p><a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/11/17/injury-as-metaphor/mh1-2/" rel="attachment wp-att-4454"><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4454" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/mh11.jpg" alt="" width="202" height="250" /></a>Perhaps the most striking and somber characteristic of injury, as with illness, is its ability to corrupt the identity of its victim.&nbsp; We see it in Tolstoy&rsquo;s Ivan Ilyich, who watches himself die in public before going through the actual process; Kafka&rsquo;s cockroach goes through his own labrum issues in the <span style="text-decoration: underline">Metamorphosis</span>.&nbsp; Those players whose body parts fail them become those body parts: Tony Saunders became a broken arm, Tommy John a ligament.</p>
<p>Perhaps no recent player has lost control over his own identity more so than Mike Hampton, whose body disintegrated after signing an 8-year, $100 million contract. Hampton became a symbol for disappointment, his salary a yoke on multiple franchises. &nbsp;He underwent Tommy John surgery, tore an oblique, tore another elbow tendon, pulled a hamstring, strained a pectoral muscle, and tore his rotator cuff. &nbsp;He said of his infamous contract:</p>
<blockquote><p>"It's unfortunate," Hampton said. "I've thought about it quite a bit. Shoot, when I sign a big contract, I want to be underpaid, not overpaid. Even though I wasn't as successful as I would have liked to have been, it wasn't from a lack of trying or lack of work or lack of want. I did everything in my power to be on the field and help my team win a World Series. I can look in the mirror and face the guy looking back and know he's telling the truth."</p></blockquote>
<p>Hampton became a perpetual joke despite working just as hard as any other person to succeed and earn his salary. &nbsp;We tend to assume that because a ballplayer makes a certain amount of money, he cannot feel the pain of his injury, the loss of being able to do what he loves. &nbsp;Instead fans feel as though their money has been stolen, as though the player should lose that, too. &nbsp;They deserve it for failing the team. &nbsp;The weakness of the flesh has become a weakness of the spirit, malevolent and blameworthy.</p>
<p><a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/11/17/injury-as-metaphor/zg1/" rel="attachment wp-att-4449"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-4449" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/11/zg1.jpg" alt="" width="160" height="250" /></a>Nowhere is the contagion of disease more glaring than when the ailment is psychological.&nbsp; Here&rsquo;s Sontag&rsquo;s metaphor breaks down; she speaks of insanity as the modern equivalent of consumption, with romantic souls shipped off to sunny climes to relax and breathe the salt air.&nbsp; Baseball, despite its emerald fields and warm spring evenings, is hardly a restorative place.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a world of machismo and spitting and dirt, of single-minded purpose and execution.&nbsp; Thinking is left for the analysts.&nbsp; So when a player succumbs to psychological issues, his exile is doubly damning; it&rsquo;s seen as being by choice.&nbsp; Zack Greinke, speaking about his battle with social anxiety, commented that &ldquo;depression is still a four-letter word.&rdquo;&nbsp; It&rsquo;s easy to think back on the spiral of Henry Skrimshander from Chad Harbach&rsquo;s <em>The Art of Fielding</em>, whose identity is not only altered by his injury, it is completely erased.&nbsp; His exile has made him unutterable, non-existent.</p>
<p>This is exactly the sentiment that Sontag was worried about: that illness and injury leads people to blame the person for their own suffering.&nbsp; Injuries are frightening and unpredictable; it&rsquo;s human nature to ascribe some cause to them, something we can control or at least understand.&nbsp; It drives us to clutch at correlation, argue over the inverted W and the pitch count the training regimen, excessive or nonexistent. &nbsp;By rationalizing the suffering of others, we explain away the possibility that it may someday arrive for us. &nbsp;We blame the player for failing to live up to our expectations, the achievements we have awarded him in advance.</p>
