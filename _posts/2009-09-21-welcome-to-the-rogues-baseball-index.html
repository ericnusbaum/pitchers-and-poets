  content: "@Alex. If you don't mind, I'll stand here in my silver gown with a quizzical
    scowl and wait for you to stumble away to your after-party at the basketball courts.\r\n\r\n@Adah.
    Not sure, pending, maybe, who knows.\r\n\r\n@Steve, thanks!"

  content: The RBI is great, and well overdue. Thanks for creating it. Any chance
    you'll add a category for the highly-competitive, friendship-destroying sport
    we call fantasy baseball? Maybe some terms like "the five tool fantasy stud" or
    "the holds hero"?

<p>We here at Pitchers and Poets are very excited to announce a new web project that we think you will enjoy. We've spent weeks in deep meditation in the nosebleeds, pecking away at the telotype exchanging correspondences with fertile-minded PnP friends, building the vitamin-enriched, high-in-fiber, and brand spanking new <strong>Rogue's Baseball Index</strong>.</p>
<p>The <a href="http://roguesbaseballindex.com">Rogue's Baseball Index</a> (or RBI for short) is what we have deemed an <strong>alternative baseball lexicon</strong>: it's a baseball dictionary, if Merriam was <a href="http://www.thedeadballera.com/BeerDrinkersKingKelly.html">Mike "King" Kelly</a> and Webster was <a href="http://www.baseballreliquary.org/lee.htm">Bill "Spaceman" Lee</a>. Eric and I thought that baseball needed a new glossary, full of terminology that describes <strong>today's baseball</strong>, from the life of the <strong>modern fan</strong> and the tics and tendencies of the <strong>modern player</strong>, to the strange ways of the GM and the creepy capers of the ballpark mascot. This is the game that you know deep down, from the <strong>rogue's mouth</strong> to your ears.</p>
<p>To celebrate the launch of RBI, we have an excellent week ahead. We've asked some of our best web friends contribute terms and definitions to RBI, and starting today we'll post several of these sage suggestions per day, incrementally exposing you to the sharp-witted wisdom of the baseball crowd.</p>
<p>The first contribution we want to highlight is that of badass artist <a href="http://mpenxa.typepad.com/">Mark Penxa</a>, who generously offered up his time and extensive talents to create a beautiful RBI logo:</p>
<p><a href="http://roguesbaseballindex.com"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-959" title="Rogue's Baseball Index logo" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/09/RBI_Logo_FINAL_350px.jpg" alt="Rogue's Baseball Index logo" width="264" height="267" /></a></p>
<p>So have a visit to the <a href="http://roguesbaseballindex.com">Rogue's Baseball Index</a>, and check back with PitchersandPoets.com daily (and multi-daily) to see the latest contributions. Hopefully you will enjoy reading RBI as much as we've enjoyed putting it all together.</p>
<p>Sincerely,<br />
Eric and Ted<br />
