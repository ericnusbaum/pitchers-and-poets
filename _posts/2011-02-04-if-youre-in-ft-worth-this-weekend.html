<p>Friend of P&amp;P -- and situational essayist -- Larry Herold's play THE SPORTS PAGE will be read<strong> (EDIT: NEXT)</strong> Sunday at 3:00 PM at Stage West Theater. I've read THE SPORTS PAGE and it's damn good. It also won the 2010 Texas Playwriting Competition. That's Feb. 20. Not the same day as the Super Bowl, which would be silly.</p>
<p>There will be food and drink. Tickets are $5.</p>
