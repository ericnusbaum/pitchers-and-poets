  content: Thanks very much, gentlemen.  And really, isn't all of the off-season boring?  Not
    even the upcoming Super Bowl and the delights of March Madness can make Opening
    Day seem closer than it is.

  content: Yeah, really is a struggle to try to write about anything? Another article
    about where Tim Brydak ends up, or who the Yankees mop-up, long reliever is?

<p>I'm mostly just posting because it's now been two weeks since Ted or I any of our friends have said anything about baseball on this here website. Rest assured that he benefits of this interlude, inexcusable as it may be in length, will soon reveal themselves. All that said, this part of the off-season is boring. There's nothing we can really do about it. Pitchers and Catchers Day is right around the corner. Football is almost over. The Winter Olympics are almost a go (watch the hockey, people). In the meantime let's busy ourselves with arbitration cases and 2010 speculation. Let's play catch&nbsp; next time the sun comes out.&nbsp; We're unsatisfied for now, but we'll be over it soon.</p>
