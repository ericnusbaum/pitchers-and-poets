<p>Bryce Harper got ejected from a JUCO World Series game recently, and for me what was more interesting than the delicate personality traits of a 17-year-old kid is the taboo that he put in the spotlight: drawing a line in the sand. Jonathan has <a href="http://minors.mlblogs.com/archives/2010/06/harper_ejection.html">the story on his B3 blog</a>.</p>
<p>Harper was ticked about a bad call on a pitch off the plate that got called for a third strike. In the course of his griping about the call to the umpire, he swiped at a spot in the dirt with his bat, presumably where he thought the pitch crossed--or in this case failed to cross--the plate. The swipe (which for my money kicked a bit of dirt at the ump as well, which is unacceptable at the college level) ticked off the ump, who tossed Harper post haste.</p>

<p>An astute commenter, astrostl,&nbsp;on Mayo's blog pointed out that, in fact, making a mark in the dirt to show where you thought the pitch was is an instantly toss-worthy offense, even at the highest levels. To very resoundingly argue his point, the commenter pointed to a <a href="http://mlb.mlb.com/news/article.jsp?ymd=20090926&amp;content_id=7170326">video of Ichiro Suzuki's first ever ejection from an MLB game</a>. Hard to argue the speed with which he was heaved.</p>
<p>I hadn't ever heard this unwritten-type rule before, and it was enlightening to have an online reading experience start with the slightly bratty ejection of a kid who in a few days will be The Business, and end with a new piece of knowledge that I will look for in MLB11: The Show.</p>
