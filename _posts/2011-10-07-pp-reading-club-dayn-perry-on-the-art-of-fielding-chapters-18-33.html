  content: I love the idea! Most of these are spot-on, and I'm impressed with your
    second-level casting options. No Angelinas or Laura Linneys here. My only dispute
    would be with the country boy Henry Skrimshander. Eisenberg, who I think is great,
    has too much New York, neurotic speed-talking in him. I see Henry being slow of
    speech and manner enough to infuriate anyone east of Ohio. I don't think I have
    the chops to find a suitable replacement among the college-aged set, so I'll leave
    it at the dick move of shooting down your proposal without offering an alternative.

  content: Ya know, funny you say so because the Eisenberg casting was the one I was
    the most conflicted about. Something off about it. I'm sure there's a better Henry
    out there ...

  content: Just was wondering about the casting myself and googled it.  I like most
    of your ideas, especially Chris Pratt!  How about Zach Gilford  for Henry?  He
    was my favorite character on Friday Night Lights.  Very introspective.

  content: I had to comment because I had mentally cast Eisenberg and Pratt too. Pratt
    was my picture of Schwartz from page 1. I've got Dennis Quaid as Affenlight, Joseph
    Gordon Levitt as Owen (whitewashing, but the book is pretty explicit about how
    surprised Guert is by Owen's race ) and Ellen Page as Pella.

</em></p>
<p>My thoughts on Phase Two of the novel that binds us? I have little to add that hasn&rsquo;t already been laid out on these pages by previous, smarter readers. I do, however, suspect that Pella and Henry will have, at they very least, a romantic dalliance in the pages to come. The problem is that any plot turn that I can anticipate is likely too obvious by half, so part of me hopes this doesn&rsquo;t come to pass. Besides, I have already developed an unhealthy interest in seeing Schwartz and Pella work things out to my satisfaction.</p>
<p>Anyhow, instead of regaling you with my lack of insight, I&rsquo;m going to cast &ldquo;The Art of Fielding: The Movie.&rdquo; Since I&rsquo;m but halfway through the book, I reserve the right to fire any and all cast members should circumstances dictate. For now, though, I decree the following:</p>
<p>Henry Skrimshander - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/find?s=all&amp;q=jesse+eisenberg">Jesse Eisenberg</a></p>
<p>He&rsquo;s gangly, awkward and withdrawn. I have no idea if he can feign the necessary athleticism, but that&rsquo;s what body double David Eckstein is for.</p>
<p>Mike Schwartz - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0695435/">Chris Pratt</a></p>
<p>The unimpeachable CelebHeights.com tells me that <a href="http://www.celebheights.com/s/P.html">Mr. Pratt is 6-foot-2</a>. He also seems capable of thesis-beard growth and related bearishness.</p>
<p>Owen Dunne - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0387752/">Thomas Hobson</a></p>
<p>If <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0942482/">Jeffrey Wright</a> were, say, 15 years younger, I&rsquo;d bestow my casting blessings upon him. Things as they are, however, I am mandating, in my Judge Lance Ito fashion, that Mr. Hobson be given the job. And, yes, my spawn inflicts Nick Jr.&rsquo;s &ldquo;Fresh Beat Band&rdquo; upon me, which is why I&rsquo;m familiar with Mr. Hobson&rsquo;s work in the first place. So Hobson is the choice. Hobson&rsquo;s choice. Ha!</p>
<p>Guert Affenlight - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0001255/">Victor Gerber</a></p>
<p>When I think of "accomplished third-generation cracker with sublimated homosexual longing," I think of James Mason. But then I remember than James Mason is dead and also terribly British. So then I think of Victor Gerber.</p>
<p>Pella Affenlight - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm1950086/">Greta Gerwig</a></p>
<p>Effortlessly attractive, smart, complicated without striving to appear so &hellip; Also, I believe I&rsquo;m in love with her. Greta, that is, not Pella. Yet.</p>
<p>Genevieve (What&rsquo;s her surname?) - <a href="http://www.imdb.com/name/nm0004986/">Lisa Gay Hamilton</a></p>
<p>The hair works, as does <a href="http://www.imdb.com/media/rm2022086912/nm0004986">the yoga-toned body</a>. She also seems capable of playing a television anchor who is orders of magnitude more lucid than you&rsquo;re garden-variety television anchor.</p>
<p>The floor is now open for complaints, well-mannered or otherwise.</p>
