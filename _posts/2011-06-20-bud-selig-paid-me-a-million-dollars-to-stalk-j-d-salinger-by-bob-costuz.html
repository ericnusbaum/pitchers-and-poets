<p>Bud Selig paid me a million dollars to hand-deliver an All-Century Team ballot to J.D. Salinger.</p>
<p>It sounds incredible, but remember, those were strange times: it was the baroque period of the Steroid Era and Bud Selig was the most powerful man in America. He had reduced the strike zone to the size of a Chiclet.  With a single sheet of MLB stationary he made Brady Anderson a home run hitter and Moises Alou a sex symbol. It has been said that in that era Bud Selig was so powerful, when he called the Minnesota Twins, Tom Kelly reached for two things: a 9 mm and a roll of toilet paper.</p>
<p>After sealing the deal with Selig, I called Jim McCarver to see if he was interested in the mission. Thirty minutes later, Jim McCarver and I parachuted out of an F-16. Me and the Vermont turf had a smooth first date.  Not so for Timmy: he impaled his leg on a weather vane on his way down. It was gnarly, ruining McCarver&rsquo;s best pair of Wranglers and compromising his ability to carry out the mission.  I dragged him into a nearby barn, gave him a Vicodin and a flare gun. That night as I crossed into New Hampshire on foot, something came over me. It was an indescribable feeling, but the last time I felt it I was covering the Summer Games in Atlanta. That was July 27, 1996.</p>
<p>For the first three weeks of my mission, I perched in an Eastern White Pine across the street from the Salinger compound. I was dressed as a mailman. My plan was to spot Salinger&rsquo;s Toyota Land Cruiser coming down the driveway, confirm my visual sans binocs, hop down from the tree and head towards the compound mailbox. It is a dogged state for a broadcast journalist to be reliant upon the whims of the fortuitous.</p>
<p>The first time I saw Salinger, it was about eight days in and the Land Cruiser was already halfway down the driveway. I was so busy scraping a melted Snicker bar out of the bottom of my fanny pack that by the time I hopped out of the tree I realized that I had left my ballots wedged in the nook of a sturdy branch. I dove into the ditch for cover.  I don&rsquo;t think he saw me.</p>
<p>Four days later, I had just closed my eyes for a tree nap when I thought I heard the sound of an SUV. It was then that my entire body spasmed and I fell out of the tree. I had kicked my shoes off while I was asleep and my socked left foot landed on a very sharp pile of rocks. The rocks cut into the soft part of my foot. I had to seal the wound with super glue. I never determined the source of the noise. I think it was a bird or maybe one of Salinger&rsquo;s neighbor&rsquo;s piglets.</p>
<p>In the wake of those two incidents, I began to feel like Chico Lind in a twelve pitch at-bat with Tim Wakefield. I drank six red bulls a day. I didn&rsquo;t sleep. A few days later, Selig called me.  He told me I had two days to get results or he would cancel the check and bring in Jose Lima.</p>
<p>Message received, commissioner.</p>
<p>That night I took a room in Cornish. I stayed in my room, got drunk, and watched Forrest Gump. It triggered a memory of a story Tony LaRussa told me after the 1988 World Series. It concerned David and the Bible. There was a time when David lived on the run from King Saul. In those days, when his very survival was threatened, David pretended to be mucho loco while eating at King Ashish&rsquo;s palace.  When I woke up I saw that I had written a note above the bathtub ring in sharpie: &ldquo;It takes leprechaun mask to get the unicorn man.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The next morning, I bought a riding lawn mower and saddled up with copious amounts of Mr. Pibb. I drove the mower back and forth on the road in front of Salinger&rsquo;s house. This did not summon Salinger.</p>
<p>The next day I got braver and mowed a series of symmetrical curlicues from the beginning of the gravel driveway to the koi ponds next to the tennis courts. This did not summon Salinger.</p>
<p>The next day I spotted smoke pouring out of the top of the big house and two sedans parked in between the trampoline and the pool. I thought to myself, the stage is set, Costuz, you have an audience and five horses under the hood. It&rsquo;s time.</p>
<p>I raced past the stone lions near the gates and towards the mandarin grove adjacent to Salinger&rsquo;s concrete bunker. I must&rsquo;ve been going fifteen MPHes when I ran over those mandarin saplings. This did not summon Salinger.</p>
<p>The next day I boarded my mower and headed straight past the rock garden and into the flowerbed. I left a few of the more Monet-looking flowers for love&rsquo;s sake but cut down the rest. This did not summon Salinger.</p>
<p>I couldn&rsquo;t take it anymore. Salinger was a god without ears. I turned off my mower and looked behind me. In the last week, I had decimated the landscape of the Salinger compound and had nothing to show for it. Drunk on the wine of conquest, like so many conquistadors before me, I climbed Salinger&rsquo;s porch steps and rapped on the door three times. Several hours later, an old man, skinny and tall like an industrial broom, opened the door. He had a navy revolver tucked into his pants.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Who the hell are you?&rdquo;</p>
