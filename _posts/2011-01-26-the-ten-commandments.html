<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2212" title="basketball" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/basketball.jpg" alt="" width="360" height="260" />In my day job as managing editor of Jew-ish.com, I had the pleasure of speaking with Bethlehem Shoals of the awesome FreeDarko about hoops, Judaism, and Seattle.&nbsp; <a href="http://jew-ish.com/index.php?/stories/item/3842">Check it out</a>.</p>
<p>Also, I may post some more about FreeDarko soon. They are a big influence on P&amp;P and once upon a time we joked (joked!) about calling this blog FreeGarko. The Undisputed Guide to Pro Basketball History is tremendous.</p>
