  content: Great post! So glad you made room for the Simpson's clip.

<p><em>The P&amp;P Lightning Round is an exercise in crowdsourcing and fast writing. Twitter suggests a topic. We spend 45 minutes writing about it. Then we post the results.</em></p>
<p>New York Mets owner Fred Wilpon is barely hanging on. In pictures he looks a broken man, shoulders sagging, face weathered in new and unkind ways. In interviews he gives the desperate impression of somebody defeated, a man trying desperately to maintain some semblance of control. But Wilpon will not maintain control.  A look at the recent history of the Mets indicates that he likely never truly had control. Fred Wilpon is already ruined.</p>
<p>George Steinbrenner, even in death, is not ruined. His post-mortem legacy maintains a tighter grip on the Yankees than a living breathing Wilpon ever could on the Mets. The years of cycling through managers and front office officials still remain fresh in the baseball consciousness. The boastful and ill-conceived statements to the media have only been further-perfected by his son Hank. The silly rules that Steinbrenner used to establish himself as unquestioned boss of the New York Yankees remain in place today.</p>
<p>The silliest of those rules, of course, are those applying to facial hair. And not just because facial hair is a silly thing to regulate, but because there were never actually any rules. Steinbrenner&rsquo;s facial hair policy was subjective. If he felt a mustache was too long, a mustache was indeed too long. The Simpsons of course parodied this with Mr. Burns questioning the length of Don Mattingly&rsquo;s sideburns to the point of absurdity.</p>

<p>Funny. Even funnier when Mattingly was actually suspended the next season for refusing to cut his hair. (I love the image of Mattingly as rebel. Someday I will write something about Mattingly and John Cougar Mellencamp as dual Indiana idols who seem different but are actually surprisingly similar.)</p>
<p>The thing about Mattingly though, is that he was Mattingly. He could afford to protest. He was a beloved figure. Steinbrenner had him suspended, but then the issue was resolved quickly. Everything went back to normal. Could you imagine a lesser player attempting something similar? Luis Sojo?</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3505" title="munsonbeard" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/munsonbeard-214x300.jpg" alt="" width="214" height="300" />I once worked at a restaurant that required clean-shaven faces from its male staff. There was an open kitchen, so even the back-house guys had to shave. Once, I showed up with about a day&rsquo;s worth of shadow &ndash; maybe even slightly less &ndash; and was scolded by a manager for it. I&rsquo;m not what you would call a regular shaver, and I thought it was a stupid rule, but the job paid really, really well. I picked my battles.</p>
<p>In retrospect, I&rsquo;m sure my manager didn&rsquo;t care about my beard. It was a power-play. Steinbrenner was likely the same way. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine him with strong feelings about the aesthetic value facial hair. It&rsquo;s easy to imagine him maneuvering in a Machiavellian way to cement his status atop the franchise. Reds owner Marge Schott, a similar if more evil strong-armer, also had a no-beard rule.</p>
<p>For Steinbrenner and his imitators (Willie Randolph and Joe Girardi instituted no-beard policies with the Mets and Yankees respectively &ndash; though tellingly, Mattingly hasn&rsquo;t with the Dodgers), rules can exist solely as a manifestation of power &ndash; and a reminder of who&rsquo;s boss. When Danny Tartabull and Paul O&rsquo;Neil shaved in the morning, they thought of George Steinbrenner. They remembered their place in the world. They remembered who was boss. It&rsquo;s hard to imagine a New York Met player having a similar thought.</p>
