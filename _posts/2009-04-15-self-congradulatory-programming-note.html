<p>This has nothing to do with baseball, but a short story I wrote called Moroccan Passageways was published today (well internet published) in a literary journal (well internet literary journal) called elimae.</p>
<p><a href="http://elimae.com/2009/04/Passage.html">Check it out here</a>.</p>
<p>And make sure you read some of the other stuff in elimae. It's actually a pretty cool lit journal -- it's been online since 1996, which in my culture<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bar_Mitzvah"> makes it a man</a>.</p>
<p>(Congratulatory cases of scotch, beer, and champagne can be sent to my home address. Please contact for details.)</p>
<p>PS: If you have 17 hours to spare, it's never too late to read <a href="http://thebaseballchronicle.com/essays/shakespeare_and_the_park">my contribution to The Baseball Chronicle</a>, which may or may not be longer than Leviticus.</p>
