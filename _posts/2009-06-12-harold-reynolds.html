<p>Today I played wiffle ball with Harold Reynolds in the studio/baseball stadium pictured below. He pitched and when I came up to the plate, he said "uh oh here comes the big guy" which was very baseball coach-ish. I hit a couple line drives off the left field fence but didn't get any over. Typical. Anyway, that's all I had to say.</p>
