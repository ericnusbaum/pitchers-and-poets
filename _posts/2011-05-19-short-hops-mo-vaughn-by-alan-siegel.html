<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3366" title="mo vaughn uppercut" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/mo-vaughn-uppercut-211x300.png" alt="" width="211" height="300" />Mo Vaughn didn't stand in the batter's box, he wedged his big body into it, hunching his shoulders and dipping his head under what I always assumed was an imaginary door frame. It's too bad I was born right-handed. I would've spent my Little League years imitating his swing, which cut through the strike zone like a pendulum and finished high in the air. I loved watching him golf opposite-field homers over the Green Monster, a decade before David Ortiz made his bones doing the same thing.</p>
