<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://passionweiss.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/mixtape.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="117" />One of the goals here is to keep tabs of baseball and its representation in art. Some of it will be popular, some of it won't. So along those lines, I'm starting the Baseball Mixtape project. Call it a collage of baseball sounds, new and old. Check out the tab up above, the list in the sidebar, and the unobtrusive music player down below.</p>
<p>I'll try to keep this jukebox fresh with close and loosely related baseball songs, clips, and other media fun. If you have any suggestions for the Baseball Mixtape, feel free to send them in via email or comment.</p>
