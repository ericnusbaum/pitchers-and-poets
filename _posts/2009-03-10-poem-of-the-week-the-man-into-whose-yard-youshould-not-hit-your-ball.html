<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode";">Because this site is called Pitchers &amp; Poets, and because we all need a little more poetry in our lives (I really believe that but only in the literal sense), this website will include some poems. They won&rsquo;t be especially hard poems. No Keats or Byron, no Milton, no Shakespeare. In fact, there won&rsquo;t be any poems at all by dead Englishmen because dead Englishmen didn&rsquo;t write about baseball.</span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode";"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode";">I hope you take the time and read the poems as we put them up each Tuesday. Comment on them. And if you like a particular poem, check out others by the author. <span> </span></span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode";"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode";">So I give you the inaugural poem of the week, by <a href="http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/115">Thomas Lux</a>.</span></p>

<p class="MsoNormal"><strong><span style="font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode";">The Man into Whose Yard You/<br />
Should Not Hit Your Ball</span></strong></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode";"> </span></p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span style="font-family: "Lucida Sans Unicode";">each day mowed<br />
and mowed his lawn, his dry quarter acre,<br />
the machine slicing a wisp<br />
from each blade's tip. Dust storms rose<br />
around the roar, 6 P.M. every day,<br />
spring, summer, fall. If he could mow<br />
the snow he would.<br />
On one side, his neighbors the cows<br />
turned their backs to him<br />
and did what they do to the grass.<br />
Where he worked, I don't know,<br />
but it set his jaw to: tight.<br />
His wife a cipher, shoebox tissue,<br />
a shattered apron. As if<br />
into her head he drove a wedge of shale.<br />
Years later, his daughter goes to jail.<br />
mow, mow, mow his lawn<br />
gently down a decade's summers.<br />
On his other side lived mine and me,<br />
across a narrow pasture, often fallow &mdash;<br />
a field of fly balls, the best part of childhood<br />
and baseball. But if a ball crossed his line,<br />
as one did in 1956<br />
and another in 1958,<br />
it came back coleslaw &mdash; his lawnmower<br />
ate it up, happy<br />
to cut something, no matter<br />
what the manual said<br />
about foreign objects,<br />
stones, or sticks.</span><em></p>
