<p>When this blog was first conceived in my imagination, it was as a sort of resource for baseball/literary info. I was thinking I'd review all the current baseball books and movies and so on and so forth. &nbsp;I thought it'd be part library, part commentary. Turns out, other than the greatly ignored Mixtape and Poems of the Week, P&amp;P is all commentary. &nbsp;And thanks to <a href="http://rksbaseballbookshelf.wordpress.com/">Ron Kaplan's Baseball Bookshelf,</a> that's fine.</p>
<p>It's fine, because the Bookshelf is really everything this blog wants to be but can't. Ron Kaplan -- according to his bio a NJ based writer and editor -- covers baseball journalism, &nbsp;literature, film, and even videogames so extensively that my doing it would be futile anyway. So go check out his blog, it's a veritable <a href="http://rksbaseballbookshelf.wordpress.com/">baseball cornucopia</a>.</p>
<p>(Make sure you come back &nbsp;though.)</p>
