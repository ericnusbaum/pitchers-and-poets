<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2226" title="pelican eating shrimp" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/01/pelican-eating-shrimp.jpg" alt="cc: via flickr user wolfpix" width="514" height="395" /></p>
<p>The end is now for <a href="http://walkoffwalk.com">Walkoff Walk</a>, one of our favorite baseball blogs to say the least. Seems important that we honor this occasion with a picture of a pelican eating a shrimp. Rob and Kris have started a Food Tumblr called<a href="http://eatoffeat.tumblr.com"> Eatoff Eat</a>. Drew Fairservice will continue to write at <a href="http://ghostrunneronfirst.com">Ghostrunner on First</a>. Dan stays at<a href="http://philadelphiawilldo.com/"> Philadelphia Will Do</a> (his own Tumblr), and as for 310toJoba, well, who knows. </p>
<p>Fellas, thanks for the memories. </p>
<p>Also: this means we can finally steal their tagline, "On baseball and the human condition," without feeling so guilty. </p>
