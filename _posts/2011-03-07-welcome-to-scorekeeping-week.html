  content: "I'm looking forward to this. I've scored most major league games I've
    attended, and taught my daughter to score games as soon as she was old enough.
    She still takes the scorebook her stepmother made for her to many games; when
    she doesn't I do.\r\n\r\nAmong my fondest memories as a child are those of my
    mother taking a large peice of butcher paper and making scorecards large enough
    for me to score the All-Star game, with all its substitutions.\r\n\r\nThis should
    be fun."

  content: "Just in response to the \"do you score; if so, how?\"\r\n\r\nYes. Generally
    I go for the diamond technique but don't shade in runs. There were phases when
    I tried to do balls and strikes by drawing a little diagram (essentially something
    like\r\n\r\nBBB\r\nSS\r\n\r\nwithout the letters actually there), but moving my
    pencil from left to right (and up and down as needed) to trace out how the count
    went. Also there were times when I tried just leaving the pencil between my LH
    middle and first fingers and moving them to track the count to myself but that
    requires sort of awkward contortions so I gave that up too. I scribble down random
    marginalia, and sometimes use arrows between batters' boxes to indicate something
    like \"this baserunner made the last out of the inning on the bases so I can't
    really put this batter down as out or safe on a fielder's choice or anything.\"\r\n\r\nI
    also try to buy individual scorecards, when possible, not more expensive magazine
    things. For a while the Twins had an independent scorecard seller outside the
    stadium which, not only was better than the official one, but coerced the Twins
    into selling individual scorecards which was good. They got driven out of the
    market though. I'm still bitter."

  content: "When I was a child I spake as a child: I started keeping score in 1966
    and still have the program filled with a nine-year-old's innocent scrawls: FO
    for fly out, GB for ground ball, etc., very low-tech.\r\n\r\nBut when I became
    a man... I worked part-time for STATS Inc., well that was a whole 'nother kettle
    of fish. \r\n\r\nI can picture the scorecard of the future with new categories
    for a more detailed experience, with advanced technologies to allow for built
    in calculators to figure out sabermetic stats. Perhaps it will feature a mechanism
    to update the players' numbers in real time, kind of like \"The Daily Prophet\"
    in the Harry Potter series."

<p>Sometimes people ask us why baseball is our favorite sport. There's no one good answer but it's easy to come up with reasons it appeals to the obsessives, the nostalgics, the fastidious among us. Scorekeeping is just one of the symptoms, in that it is more than just keeping score, it is an institution. The language of scorekeeping, the history and the symbolism, speak to our collective desire to log the proceedings, to set the course of events down on paper.</p>
<p>Buried in the subconscious of the every amateur scorekeeper is the fantasy that someday, years into the future, a researcher will stumble across that mustard-stained scorecard from a Sunday afternoon in Arlington, and use it to construct the final, Rosebud-like paragraph of said scorekeeper&rsquo;s biography.</p>
<p>The point is, this Scorekeeping Week at Pitchers &amp; Poets. We felt like the act of scorekeeping was both personal enough and broad enough to justify an entire week of posts, from a range of perspectives, from the graphic designer to the professional broadcaster, and all of the fans in between.</p>
<p>This is also the first time we have ever laid claim to a week, labeled it, and singled it out for any official purpose. Seeing as scorekeeping is a universal activity, we hope that you ponder it along with us on your own blog, or better yet in our comments section.</p>
<p>In the next few days you can look forward to interviews with scorebook visionary Bethany Heck and with Seattle Mariners TV broadcaster Dave Sims, as well as reflections from friends of the site, all on the topic of scorekeeping.</p>
