  content: "<i>Nothing, really, about Cecil Fielder makes any sense. That&rsquo;s
    why he&rsquo;s the first baseman of the 90s.</i>\r\n\r\nSo true. I simply cannot
    argue.\r\n\r\nI'll never forget watching Fielder smash one literally outside the
    walls of Tiger Stadium. That, in a nutshell, was 90s baseball."

He used to be able to dunk a basketball. He named his son Prince (does he think he&rsquo;s a king?). He struck out three more times than he hit. I only remember him from a flimsy Detroit Tigers card I got in a cereal box and a season-and-a-half with the Yankees. But I think he was good sometimes, and I know his name makes no sense. Nothing, really, about Cecil Fielder makes any sense. That&rsquo;s why he&rsquo;s the first baseman of the 90s.</p>
