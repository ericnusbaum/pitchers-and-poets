<p>Next to <a href="http://cardboardgods.net">Josh Wilker's</a>, most people's writing, including my own, is two dimensional -- as flat as a cardboard rectangle. I could pile on hyperbole for hours, but this speaks for itself. Josh, who has been excessively friendly to this less accomplished writer in a few email exchanges, was profiled in the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/04/05/sports/baseball/05collect.html">Sunday New York Times</a>. The story also announces that he's signed a contract to bring Cardboard Gods into book form. He couldn't be more deserving of the feature or the book deal. I can't wait to read the finished product.</p>
