<p>In this, the second Pitchers &amp; Poets podcast, Ted and I discuss everything from rotisserie chicken to rotisserie baseball. And that's just in the last five minutes. We discuss a pair of big-time retirements that happened this Winter, namely Nomar Garciaparra* and Frank Thomas. I talk about why I want to be Nomar's friend, and Ted explains why he prefers The Big Hurt stylistically to his 1990s AL co-star Ken Griffey Jr.</p>
<p>Next it's onto Spring Training and the early shock of seeing players in new uniforms -- especially the hideous alternate jerseys and mesh caps worn in the Florida and Arizona sunshine.&nbsp; Finally, we bring it around to baseball books, discussing in particular Sam Walker's 2006 gem <em>Fantsyland</em>**, which leads us, of course, to the all-important chickens.</p>
<p>*This is a cool story: when I was 9 or 10, my mom broke her ankle. In physical therapy, she met this nice young man who was a minor league baseball player for the Red Sox. He was very friendly and polite, she said when she got home, and he signed you and your brothers autographs. He had a funny name. Needless to say, we were quite shocked to see that same guy become Nomar Garciaparra and win the AL Rookie of the Year a short time later.</p>
<p>**<em>Fantasyland</em> was bought for me by my aunt Shelly who heard an NPR interview in which the book was praised. It sat on my shelf for a few months before it was recommended a second time by Corban Goble of <a href="http://epiloguemagazine.com">Epilogue Magazine</a>. Thank you to both of them making me pick up this book. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Fantasyland-Season-Baseballs-Lunatic-Fringe/dp/0670034282">Buy it here</a>.</p>
