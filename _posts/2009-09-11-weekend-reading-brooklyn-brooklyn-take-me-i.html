  content: "First off, love the cover of Take Me Out To The Ballgame by The Hold Steady.
    Awesome.\r\n\r\nAnd second, he Times article about the Bears is just fascinating
    from a \"former gloryt athlete\" kind of way."

<p>It's September 11th. Those words mean so much more in New York City today. Here's an apt new song by the Avett Brothers and some New York baseball reading.</p>

<li>Few people, if anybody, can write about baseball like Roger Angell. His easy, lyrical prose captures the joyful meaninglessness of the game so perfectly. Notice how he refers to a certain Yankee shortstop by his first name in this <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/tny/2009/09/angell-jeter-gehrig.html">pleasant little <em>New Yorker</em> essay</a>. It's as if he is writing about his friends -- he respects the ballplayers as humans, not as greater beings on a pedestal.</li>
<li>Todd Drew's <a href="http://www.bronxbanterblog.com/2008/11/07/lasting-yankee-stadium-memory-53/">Lasting Yankee Stadium Memory</a> entry on the Bronx Banter Blog has been selected by Leigh Montville as part of the newest edition of Best American Sports Writing. It's only the second blog entry to be selected for the series, edited by friend of PnP Glenn Stout. Todd isn't around to see it, but if you read the piece you'll understand how deserving he is. As Bronx Banter's Alex Belth put it&nbsp; <em>"To be included in this series&ndash;one that he adored to no end&ndash;would have knocked him on his ass."</em></li>
<li><a href="http://jeffpearlman.com/?p=2976">Jeff Pearlman has had it</a> with the 2009 edition of the New York Mets. He even makes an unfortunate comparison to the awful Bobby Bonilla Mets of 1992. Pearlman writes: &nbsp; "Although these 2009 Mets are not nearly as bad, humanity-wise, as the edition from 17 years ago, the season has been an even greater disaster.</li>
<li>And because much of north Jersey is practically a borough, I include this <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/09/09/sports/baseball/09bears.html?_r=1&amp;partner=rss&amp;emc=rss">great story from the <em>New York Times</em></a> about the Newark Bears and their litany of veteran major leaguers waiting for -- and not getting -- that big September call up.&nbsp; Keith Foulke. Armando Benitez. Jacque Jones. Carl Everett. The list goes on. (via <a href="http://eastwindupchronicle.com/?p=5724">East Windup Chronicle</a>)</li>
