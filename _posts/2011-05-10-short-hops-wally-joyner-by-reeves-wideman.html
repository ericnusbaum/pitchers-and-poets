  content: As a KC native, I also recall the brief stint of Mr. Joyner before/after
    his time with the Angels. Even Sweeney wasn't able to cast away the shadow of
    George Brett, whose pine tar yell-fest makes great youtube viewing in the annals
    of sports history.

  content: You must judge great by RBIs. Dude played gold glove defense and was a
    terrific hitter. Actually had 3 great years (93-95).

  content: "Brett's career OPS .857\r\nJoyner's OPS from 1993-1995: .842, .835, .842\r\nAdd
    gold glove defense to those numbers and \"fine but never great\" undersells his
    years in KC."

Fine but never great is basically what being a Royals fan felt like from 1992 to 1995. Squeezed between George Brett and Mike Sweeney, Wally Joyner was also the first basemen of the formative years in my life as a sports fan. I chose basketball.</p>
