<p>I'm headed to a minor league game tonight between the <a href="http://everett.aquasox.milb.com">Everett Aquasox</a> and the <a href="www.canadiansbaseball.com">Vancouver Canadians</a>, a Northwest League short season A-ball match-up. A ritual that I like to go through before hitting a minor league park--aside from donning my raggedy Astros <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2009/08/27/the-state-of-the-cap/">cap</a>--is to research who the supposed "top prospects" in the game are. It's a tough thing to keep up with, the prospects game, beyond the top 20 or so, but I've found that it can be a great way to engage with a randomly attended minor league game.</p>
<p>The guys who show up as top prospects do seem to have an air about them that sets them apart: a little stronger, a little more relaxed in the batter's box. Just...something. I watch them a little more closely, noting the quickness of their hands or the snap of their fastball, and their hands seem a little quicker, their fastballs a little snappier than everyone else's.</p>
<p>It is likely that these are tricks of the mind, and that I perceive these chosen players as superior because their status has been planted into my brain by the bloggerati. This is a notable 180 from the usual baseball blogging/SABRmetric goal of pointing out who is actually better than he appears to be to the naked eye.</p>
<p>The real trick would be to take my amateur scout's eye to a game and make the determination myself about who looks the sharpest. Then I could check that against the prospect lists and see what happens. Granted, one game is nothing on lengthy scouting trips and reports, but I have to think that most scouting--by anybody, at any level except the highest--is firmly rooted in the second hand to begin with.</p>
<p>It's too late to try this experiment tonight, as I've already got the names of the chosen ones bouncing around in my head, but perhaps soon I will trek to minor league parks unknown and challenge myself to a Scout-Off. It's me VS. the Internet. I'd better wear my glasses.</p>
<p>How do you watch a minor league game? Is it all beers, conversation and promo night hi jinks, or do you try and get into the prospect-watching yourself?</p>
<p>(For the record, my favorite prospect site is John Sickel's <a href="http://www.minorleagueball.com/">Minor League Ball</a>.)</p>
