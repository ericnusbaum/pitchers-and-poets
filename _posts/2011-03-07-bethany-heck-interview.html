She is a graphic designer  whose <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1003031250/the-eephus-league-baseball-scorebook-revival-proje">Eephus League Baseball Scorebook Revival project on Kickstarter</a>, seeking funds to help produce a reimagined  and better-designed baseball scorebook, has bounced around the baseball  blogosphere for a couple weeks. It even captured the disconnected and  rarely timely imaginations of Ted and myself. She is also behind the  <a href="http://eephusleague.com">Eephus League</a>, an online repository of stylish baseball artifacts.  Bethany and I discussed scorekeeping in terms of baseball fandom, and  her own unique project.</p>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong> Tell us about your website, the Eephus League. It&rsquo;s stunning full of  great design, great images, great everything. But what exactly is it? I  don&rsquo;t even know where to start.</p>
<p><strong>Bethany:</strong> Well, it is a hard thing to describe, isn&rsquo;t it? It&rsquo;s about everything  and nothing. It&rsquo;s a safe haven for all the random things that occur in  and because of baseball. There were so many things about baseball that I  loved, but no one site to house them all, and none of them allowed user  participation either. So I made the Eephus League to fill that selfish  desire!</p>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong> So out of a clearing house full of marginalia, novelty items, and other  disconnected treasures comes an ambitious, artistic, and clearly very  popular mission to redesign and essentially restart the baseball  scorebook?</p>
<p><ins datetime="2011-03-07T07:04:27+00:00">I look at today&rsquo;s scorecards, with 50 subdivisions per batter, per inning, and well... it&rsquo;s not fun. It&rsquo;s not inviting.</ins><strong>Bethany:</strong> Yes.  Scorekeeping has always been something that interested me from a record  keeping and visual standpoint, and I love looking back at older  scorebook designs. They were so  much simpler, and you can see why more people kept score back then.  Then I look at today&rsquo;s scorecards, with 50 subdivisions per batter, per  inning, and well... it&rsquo;s not fun. It&rsquo;s not inviting. And come on, those  books are hideous. I wanted something that would make not only  scorekeeping, but baseball cool again.</p>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong> When and how did you learn how to keep score? Was it love at first filled-in diamond?</p>
<p><strong>Bethany:</strong> I wish I had a romantic story about my first experience, but it was at  Fulton County Stadium with my father, I was probably 7 years old, and  after getting t shirts, pennants, and a duffle bag at the gate, we sat  down and he pointed out the scorecard to me, explained a few things. I  didn&rsquo;t keep it up for long, but that was my first experience. I did it  off and on until I started working on the Eephus League last summer.</p>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong> Were there any particular scorebooks that influenced you? Or even  non-baseball material, as you came up with the aesthetics for your own?  Ted said they reminded him on the outside of moleskine notebooks.</p>
<p><strong>Bethany:</strong> Well Ted is definitely correct about the influence of Moleskine  sketchbooks. Once I decided that I was going to make scorebooks, I  looked at the different sketchbooks on the market and Moleskines were my  favorite. I used that as a size basis and for things like the flap in  the back to hold extra materials. The question I asked myself was &ldquo;if  Moleskine made a scorebook, what would it look like?&rdquo; There are some  older scorecards that were pocket sized that were especially  inspirational. Teeny tiny grids and limited columns, and you realize  that scorekeeping only has to be as space-consuming as you want it to  be.</p>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong> Why scorekeeping in particular -- why should the masses be taking it up? And what&rsquo;s lost when we don&rsquo;t keep score by hand?</p>
<p><strong>Bethany:</strong> Why doesn&rsquo;t everyone keep score? &nbsp;Baseball is a relaxed game, it&rsquo;s  mostly downtime, and scorekeeping is a great way to fill the empty  spaces. To start over, I focused on scorekeeping because I think it&rsquo;s an  incredible art that&rsquo;s dying. It&rsquo;s rare that you see someone keeping  score at a game, and the ones you do see are mostly older folks. And the  current scorebook designs are not something you can just plop in a  &nbsp;teenagers lap and say &ldquo;hey, have at it!&rdquo;</p>

<p><strong>Eric:</strong> Speaking of the artistic aspect, I remember playing high school  baseball, and one of our coaches had this palm pilot-y electronic thing  we had to use to keep score. It was so embarrassing to sit in the dugout  and punch numbers on it with the little stylus like some sort of lost  field engineer. Then again, I had terrible hand-writing. So I guess it  was fine in that respect.</p>
<p><strong>Bethany:</strong> That&rsquo;s rough. Scorekeeping needs to be done by hand, in my opinion, or  with some sort of calligraphic input. It&rsquo;s like a secret language that  is passed along, and everyone adds their own little bits to the  vernacular.</p>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong> Are there any especially awesome or unique flourishes you&rsquo;ve come across? Any odd bits of slang?</p>
<p><strong>Bethany: </strong> There are so many! I heard recently from an Eephus League member who  draws a line past first to indicate a single, and the line stop at the  base for a walk. Things like using an exclamation point to note an  exceptional play on the field are great. Some people use dots to  indicate balls thrown, slashes for swinging strikes, and so on. I love  that stuff.</p>
<p><del datetime="2011-03-07T07:04:27+00:00">Scorekeeping is storytelling, at its heart.</del><strong>Eric:</strong> What is it about visual design that can elicit that kind of expression?  What I mean is, why does your &nbsp;version of the scorebook allow for  people to keep score artistically, while another version makes for a  dull coding experience. Is it simply space?</p>
<p><strong>Bethany:</strong> I think it has to do with the overall presentation of the page. I was  careful to keep generous margins and to have minimal extra content in  the grid. When you add that stuff, you&rsquo;re almost telling someone how to  score. &ldquo;Put this here.&rdquo; I hope my design encourages more freedom of  expression.</p>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong> How can scorekeeping be a social act, an act of sharing and community?</p>
<p><strong>Bethany:</strong> I think any time you&rsquo;ve got a group of people together keeping score,  you&rsquo;re going to have an exchange of technique. &ldquo;How did you score that?  Hey, what do the dashes mean?&rdquo; I also want to add a section to the  Eephus League site that chronicles different notation techniques. You  might come across something that makes perfect sense to you and decide  to use it or adapt it for your own use. I also love seeing completed  scorecards that other people have kept, so that is a very social thing  for me. Scorekeeping is storytelling, at its heart.</p>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong> How has the reception been so far for the scorebook project? As of now, you&rsquo;re well past your Kickstarter goal.</p>
<p><strong>Bethany:</strong> The reception has been far better than I could have hoped for. When I  started the project, a friend saw the amount I was aiming for and was  extremely doubtful that I&rsquo;d make it. I sold over 530 scorebooks through  pre-orders in a week, and it&rsquo;s not even baseball season yet. I&rsquo;m so  overwhelmed. People say they are going to use it for their first  scorebook, which is so exciting for me.</p>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong> What are you doing about production? I imagine you aren&rsquo;t handcrafting all 530 before Opening Day...or are you?</p>
<p><strong>Bethany:</strong> Hah, thankfully I don&rsquo;t have to. I have a local printer who is going to  print all of the books. The only sacrifice I had to make was the  stitching down the side. It&rsquo;s going to be stapled 3 times instead. It  won&rsquo;t hurt the function of the book, thankfully, it will still be plenty  sturdy. I do have to make the bands for the outside and the reference  cards all myself, so that&rsquo;s going to be fun.</p>

<p><strong>Eric:</strong> Why Kickstarter? In retrospect, it was obviously a great decision, but  did you know that this was the kind of project that could kick up  grassroots support? Or was it more of a &ldquo;what the hell, let&rsquo;s see what  happens&rdquo; kind of thing?</p>
<p><strong>Bethany:</strong> Definitely more of the latter. I knew I had a large amount of money  that was going to be required to &nbsp;get the books made, and I really  didn&rsquo;t have a good feel for how many I should be producing. Kickstarter  was a chance to solve both problems. When I submitted the project, I  didn&rsquo;t expect them to accept me.</p>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong> I didn&rsquo;t realize it was a competitive thing -- I thought anybody could  get on there within reason, and then the people spoke for themselves. So  you had to sell Kickstarter on this idea?</p>
<p><strong>Bethany:</strong> In a way, yes. You tell them about the project, how much you want to  raise, etc. They have certain restrictions about what you can and can&rsquo;t  raise money for.</p>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong> So what&rsquo;s next? I imagine you will be taking this project beyond  Kickstarter, and maybe even perhaps the initial scorebook offering?</p>
<p><strong>Bethany:</strong> Well,  the end goal is to get MLB licensing and to offer books with the  correct colors for every team, team logos on the book, and seating  charts in the pages where you can draw in where you sat. But for now,  I&rsquo;ve got to sell a lot more scorebooks!</p>
<p><em>As of this writing, Bethany has just about doubled her fundraising goal of $10,000, but if you want, you can still donate -- and lay claim to your very own Eephus League merchandise, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/1003031250/the-eephus-league-baseball-scorebook-revival-proje">over at Kickstarter</a>.</em></p>
