  content: I actually like when Leiter does that. He is actually pretty interesting&mdash;coming
    across as a pitcher who was fairly cerebral (maybe not Greg Maddux, but a thoughtful
    guy), he analyzes when a pitcher isn't pitching well, or when he is and tells
    you why. Unlike the John Maddens (He sees the hole, then runs through it!"), I
    apreciate Leiter.

  content: I haven't seen Leiter himself do it, but I definitely enjoy them in general.
    Smoltz seems like an early candidate to do it a lot, at least when he's not talking
    about golf.

<p>I enjoy it when retired pitchers turned broadcasters in expensive ties grab a baseball that some intern had to scare up for them and demonstrate how to throw a cutter or a circle change. The starched cuff of a fine dress shirt, a little bling on the fingers and slow demonstrative arm gestures remind me of Little League, when the dad who was also a lawyer would pull up in his beamer and teach the kids a thing or two before heading off to the steakhouse to make deals.</p>
<p>My dad never worked nine-to-five, so I suppose there was something mysterious about these well-dressed, clean-shaven dads. I didn't envy them. In fact from the beginning I thought it was tacky to put a glove on and toss it around in business clothes. It didn't feel right. I didn't appreciate, at the time, the tightening noose of time that each day presents.</p>
<p>But I digress. The reason I brought it up is because FackYouk has an awesome <a href="http://fackyouk.blogspot.com/2010/05/al-leiters-magic-baseball.html">dramatization of an Al Leiter broadcast booth demonstration</a>. What he is demonstrating, I have no idea. I do know that is is Magic&reg;. <em></em></p>
