<p>On Saturday I went to a panel discussion on the &lsquo;comic imagination.&rsquo; It was pretty funny. Joining me in the audience was a Pulitzer Prize-winning sports writer who covered baseball in the 1980s for the NY Times. In a discussion of context, he mentioned that in clubhouses, you can pretty much say anything to anybody. In sports (incoming pun intended), nothing is out of bounds.</p>
<p>To back up his point he shared this anecdote, a batting practice exchange between former Pittsburgh  teammates Bill Madlock and Lee Mazzilli as they prepared to face off in a Spring Training game. Madlock was with the Dodgers and Mazzilli with the Mets:</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Madlock</strong>: So Lee, I&rsquo;m new here and you know this town. You have a girl lined up for me tonight right?</p>
<p><strong>Mazzilli</strong>: I&rsquo;m not a miracle worker, Bill</p>
<p><strong>Madlock</strong>: Aww come on, You&rsquo;ve got to know somebody.</p>
<p><strong>Mazzilli</strong>: Well, there&rsquo;s always my wife I guess.</p>
<p><strong>Madlock</strong>: Nah no thanks, I had your wife last spring, looking for something new.</p></blockquote>
<p>It's worth noting, I think, that Lee Mazzilli and his wife Dani, appear to have a <a href="http://www.prosportsdaily.com/forums/showthread.php?t=260320">wonderful marriage and family</a></p>
