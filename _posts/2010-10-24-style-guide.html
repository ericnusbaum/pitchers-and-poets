<p>Jesse Thorn is a style maven, podcaster, <a title="the sound of young america" href="http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/sound-young-america">radio host</a> and all-around fun person who creates a lot of great entertainment content of all kinds on the web. When he talks about baseball on his podcast, <a title="Jordan Jesse Go" href="http://www.maximumfun.org/shows/jordan-jesse-go">Jordan, Jesse, Go!</a>, however, his co-host <a title="Jordan Morris twitter" href="http://twitter.com/#!/jordan_morris">Jordan Morris</a> makes fun of him doggedly. When he does get to talk baseball, it's under a cloud of barely veiled boredom and tenuous tolerance. It's nice to see him cut loose.</p>
