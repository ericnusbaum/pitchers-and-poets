<p>August has been slow at Pitchers &amp; Poets, but fear not. We're getting back into the swing of things. Ted and I have a great new project underway (you'll hear a lot about it in the coming weeks), and we've both settled nicely into the semblance of routine after cross-country moves.&nbsp; <strong>Good things are coming</strong> so take this as a reminder to check back frequently, add us to your RSS feed, and engage with us on as many social media platforms as you possibly can.</p>
