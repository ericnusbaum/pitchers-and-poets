<p><em><img class="alignleft" src="http://www.eteamz.com/gcu/images/umpire.jpg" alt="" width="151" height="142" />New York Times </em>theater critic and reporter Bruce Weber (not the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bruce_Weber_(coach)">basketball coach</a>) went to umpire school to write a book. That book,&nbsp; 'As They See 'Em' is out now.</p>
<p>Read the first chapter <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/03/13/books/chapters/chapter-as-they-seem-em.html?pagewanted=1">here.<br />
</a></p>
<p>Or save yourself twenty minutes and read this very short paragraph from the end of that first chapter:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>In umpire nation, Applebee's and Chili's are high-end establishments, steak is a gourmet meal, and, for some reason, lite beer is preferable to regular beer. It's a place where the playing of the national anthem before a ball game is serious business, where women are discomforting, Jews are a novelty, homosexuals are unwanted, and liberals tend to keep their opinions to themselves.</em></p></blockquote>
<p>Umpires, it turns out, are a lot like other&nbsp; middle-aged, middle-America, blue-collar white guys.</p>
<p>It's easy to suspect that Bruce Weber has not spent a great deal of time between the coasts. It's also easy to suspect that this will be a book in which a coast-dwelling, fairly wealthy writer romanticizes a profession he sees as 'honest' or 'gritty,' but then realizes 2/3 of the way through that the lifestyle is a lot harder than it looks and really not for him. Just guessing.</p>
