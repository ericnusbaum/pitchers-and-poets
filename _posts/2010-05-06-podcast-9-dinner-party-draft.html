  content: "Not to sound overly xenophobic, but all 5 of my guests would have to be
    fairly comfortable speaking English. Otherwise the dinner could have too many
    awkward silences and the depth of the conversations would be very shallow. \r\n\r\nMy
    table of 5 would include:\r\n\r\n1)Ichiro: What would he wear? Would he bring
    his interpreter? His quotes are often deep and/or hilarious. Just a fascinating
    guy.\r\n\r\n2)Jamie Moyer: In the majors since 1986. Pitched in his first World
    Series at age 45+. Played with the likes of: Eckersley, Palmeiro, Ripken Jr.,
    Mussina, Valenzuela, Griffey, A-Fraud, etc. He and his wife are two of the most
    chariable people on Earth and she is the daughter of Digger Phelps. There is no
    way our table would run out of things to discuss.\r\n\r\n3)Manny Ramirez: I'm
    a bit worried he may fall asleep or leave unexpectedly. If he stays focused, hopefully
    we'd be able to coax him to tell us some of his ridiculous anecdotes. \r\n\r\n4)Jason
    Heyward: Need some young blood at the table. It'd be interesting to hear a young
    player's perspective of different topics, and he seems to have good head on his
    shoulders. Plus, I can shower him with the praise he deserves for carrying a few
    of my fantasy teams. Just what he would want to hear, I'm sure.\r\n\r\n5)Bronson
    Arroyo: Rounding out the 5 with a musician. He does a serviceable cover of \"Plush\"
    by STP and can provide background music for the many stories Jamie Moyer tells."

    I know and sometimes it gets me through the day. You kick Ass. Can I say that?\r\n\r\nKeep
    it going!!!!\r\n\r\n-Box"
