He was like a columnist's wet dream, a big, square-jawed kid who looked like Superman, swooped into the Bronx during some dismal days for the home team, and offered the kind of strike-it-rich promise that we all dream about. Especially when your team is losing. He was straight out of "The Natural"--the Reagan-Era movie, not the magic realism novel. And of course he was too good to be true. It all happened so fast I'm not sure it happened at all.</p>
