  content: For me, the last question comes first and forces all of the above. I don't
    drive, and even when I have access to public transportation, that particular form
    of public transportation sometimes makes it...how you say...still in my best interest
    to travel with others. So then it does become a question of sitting around and
    waiting for an invitation, and from there, all else follows. In the long term,
    it's likely I'll be attending games on my own someday, but logistics make that
    less likely in the short and medium terms.

<p>The magic of attending a baseball game may begin when you present your  ticket at the gate, but no spell can be cast without adequate  preparation.  Before the first pitch the would-be attendee faces a  gauntlet of decisions, ranging from checking the schedule for the  presence of the home team to pondering whether skipping work on a  Wednesday afternoon to watch the 5-starter is really acceptable.  The  alchemy of preparation may have numerous permutations, but there are  four ingredients of particular importance, namely: Who, What, When, and  How.  Without these, which arise for every game-goer, the stadium might  as well not exist.</p>

<p><strong>Who am I going with?</strong></p>
<p>Whether it's the wife, a  college friend, a co-worker, or an awkward uncle, choosing a partner or  group of co-attendees is a precursor even to picking a game.  While  this is a relatively simple question, the process of making this choices  says a lot about the potential attendee.  For example, the less  authoritative personality is not likely to choose at all, rather waiting  for the game to come to him in the form of an invitation.  The  gregarious carouser, on the other hand, is wont to invite five or six  friends, especially if he's got someone to impress.  The especially  magnanimous, but secretly lonely, man will offer to buy everyone's  tickets and beers if only they'll come along, while the lazy and  anti-social man will just drag his wife along for fear of getting in  contact with - and being rejected by - anyone else.  One might  justifiably wonder how he has a wife in the first place, but that's  beside the point.</p>
<p>Any one of us might be any one of those people at any time, or we  might default to a single game-attending modus.  Regardless, whether we  follow habit or not, having answered "who" we proceed to "what."</p>
<p><strong>What game are we going to?</strong></p>
<p>The all-mighty  schedule imposes certain limitations on this question.  If the home team  is in the backwaters of Pittsburgh and Washington for the next week the  game-going impulse will not be immediately satiated.  If, on the other  hand, the darkened dates on the calendar indicate a glorious 14-game  homestand, the proverbial cup runneth over.</p>
<p>Having perused possibilities, choosing a particular one - or, hey,  maybe two or three - is a relatively simple function of available money  (lets call that "M"), and time and date of games (call it "T").  Taking  the result of "Who," (or W) as a coefficient, each potential game ("G")  is scored as follows: G = T / W*M.  That is, the likelihood of going to a  given game is equal to the convenience of the date, factoring in who is  going and how much it's likely to cost.  I might have the formula  slightly wrong, but I trust some enterprising sabermetrician will spot  the error and correct it.</p>
<p><strong>When do we get there?</strong></p>
<p>The question comes  with the  all-important corollary, "What do we eat?"  Ballpark food has  its  advantages, but price is not among them.  On the other hand, there  are  some fans who insist upon arriving an hour before the game to sit   around and watch players stretch and take batting practice, which makes a   pre-game meal and drink a trickier proposition.</p>
<p>The other  corollary, here, is "How are we getting our tickets?"   Scalping is a  viable option, but is best done right before the first  pitch, when the  fickle baseball-ticket market suddenly shifts in the  buyer's favor.  A  baseball ticket is a rare thing that can be worth as  much as one  hundred dollars one moment, less than ten a few minutes  later, and  nothing at all the next day.  Finding the right time to  strike is  vital.</p>
<p>Buying online, or buying walk-up, on the other hand,  requires a  somewhat earlier arrival, as the line at the ticket-office  is liable to  make even the most optimistic fan despair for humanity.   Questions that  might arise, especially if first pitch is imminent,  include: "How can it  take so long for the guy in front to buy a single  ticket?" and,  "Why  would they hire a deaf saleswoman?" and, if the  home team is playing  everyone's favorite lovable losers, "What are all  these freaking Cubs  fans doing here? This isn't Chicago!"*</p>
<p><em>*The reader should disregard this last question if he or she is, in fact in Chicago.</em></p>

<p><strong>How do we get there?</strong></p>
<p>Finally,  the most important question of all.  Having settled the simple stuff,  the real getting to the park must be negotiated.  Public transportation,  a nice walk (if you live close enough), the horrors of driving and  parking, or some combination of the three are all valid options.  While  location has a lot to do with the decision, here, it doesn't change the  finality.  Once the car is fired up, the train is boarded, or those  first steps out of the apartment have been taken, the stadium experience  has begun.  It's only a matter of time before, settling into his seat,  the stadium-goer can sit back and let the game wash over him, talking  with his particular whos.  Cue National Anthem, starting lineups, and  first pitch.  Put aside all troubles and worries, including the very  effort of getting there.</p>
<p><em>As a coda, I want to address the absence of the other two  classic journalistic questions: "Where" and "Why."  I have left these  out because the former is exceedingly simple and the latter exceedingly  complicated.  In other words, if "Where is the stadium?" is an important  question in your particular game-going experience, you're clearly in an  unusual situation.  If "Why am I going to the game?" is an important  question in the pre-game process, well, you'll just have to answer for  yourself.</em></p>
