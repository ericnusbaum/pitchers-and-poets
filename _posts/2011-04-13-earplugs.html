    the high-powered Mariner offense.'

    not being too difficult to make, though they''re obviously different characters

<p>In honor of Milton Bradley and his earplugs, Ted and I have decided to begin a campaign. In the tradition of the Rangers' #claw and #antlers gestures, we want to get the Mariners -- not just Milton to begin using #earplugs. Kind of like this:</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://s1.torbit.com/img/35d0c37d931540504e8b2b6a2ed9177e7cbcd4f0-hulk-hogan-fingers-in-ears.jpg.webp" alt="" /></p>
<p>Seeing Ichiro (or even Ryan Langerhans, or especially Bradley) do the earplugs after an RBI double would be all the vindication Ted and I could ever want as bloggers. We urge you to get in on #earplugs now. Spread the word. This isn't a revolution, but it may be something close. </p>
