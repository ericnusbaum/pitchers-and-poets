<p>I've been a woefully inept shipmate on the SS Pitchers&amp;Poets of late, so this evening I will celebrate my renewed commitment to yammering on about baseball by LIVEBLOGGING THE HOME RUN DERBY (8 o'clock Eastern, 5 o'clock Pactific).</p>
<p>I've never LIVEBLOGGED before, so this will be as new to me as the All-Star experience is to Nick Swisher.</p>
<p>In anticipation of this major media event, here's an <a href="http://www.nypost.com/p/blogs/hardball/up_more_thoughts_on_lee_trade_fZPq0skMLfj9mAUNIURryN">unrelated article</a> by Joel Sherman, NYPost, on the Jack Z negotiations leading up to the Cliff Lee deal, that I found via <a href="http://www.mlbtraderumors.com/">MLBtraderumors.com</a>. It's all quite dramatic.</p>
