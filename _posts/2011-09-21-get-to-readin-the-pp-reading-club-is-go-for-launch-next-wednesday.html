  content: I'm super super stoked for this - I also would like to suggest the possible
    theme and comparison/contrast with "The Natural." And I refer to the novel, not

<p>This week, we're going to feature some thoughts from our team of writers, who will reflect on their expectations, some ideas about reading baseball books, and more in preparation for next week's big start.</p>
<p>Here's the plan: We read a pre-determined set of chapters, and then we write, Tweet, and talk about that selection on the week's Wednesday.</p>
<p>For <em>next</em> Wednesday, we'll be discussing chapters 1-17 of the book.</p>
<p>If it's food for thought you're after as you anticipate and dig into the book and look to get the old brain cells firing, consider <a title="slate the art of fielding" href="http://www.slate.com/id/2302764/">this review of The Art of Fielding at Slate</a>, <a title="corban goble chad harbach" href="http://www.theawl.com/2011/09/a-conversation-with-chad-harbach-author-of-the-art-of-fielding">this interview with Chad Harbach</a> by Pitchers &amp; Poets contributor Corban Goble for The Awl, and <a title="alan cheuse the art of fielding" href="http://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/books/ct-books-review-art-of-fielding-harbach,0,7773863.story">this review by Alan Cheuse</a> at the Trib. That should get you started.</p>
<p>This week, we'll feature some early thoughts from our contributors-slash-conversation starters</p>
