<p><em><a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/category/1990s-first-baseman-week/"></a>Don't ask us where Dylan Little came from. He is, according to himself, a lifeguard at a turtle hospital. You can follow him on Twitter <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/orangehunchback">@orangehunchback</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>Interviewer's Note</strong>: While at a Ponderosa Steakhouse in Cincinnati, Ohio I ran into former Reds legend <a title="hal morris" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/m/morriha02.shtml">Hal Morris</a>. He sat in a booth adjacent to the buffet. At first it appeared that he had a stack of pancakes on his plate, but further inspection revealed that the flapjacks were instead three thin steaks covered in beef gravy. Morris had no beverage save a bowl of cherry pie filling. Though I was interrupting his meal, Mr. Morris exhibited the grace you would expect from a man with a career OBP of .361.</p>

<p><strong>Hal Morris</strong>: At first it was like Chris Sabo dragging you to the mall so he could shop for a new pair of ball googles, and sometimes it's like your down in Sarasota and Eric Davis keeps crapping in your scooper.</p>
<p><strong>IV</strong>: That sounds brutal. Was hazing typical?</p>
<p><strong>HM</strong>: I don't know. I guess so. I helped some dudes pour some Skyline Chili in Reggie Sanders' Walkman the next year. But you&rsquo;re missing the point. That was a World Series Team. World&rsquo;s Champions. Hell, I would&rsquo;ve let Mariano drop Duncan donuts on the dash of my Fiero if it meant another ring.</p>
<p><strong>IV</strong>: Were you nervous taking over first base duties for Todd Benzinger?</p>
<p><strong>HM</strong>: Not really... Piniella thought Toddy Benz was so ugly at first base he practically gave the spot away.</p>
<p><strong>IV</strong>: Do you mean that Pineilla didn't think Benzinger was a good fielder?</p>
<p><strong>HM</strong>: No, Benzo was a solid ball player. I don&rsquo;t know what I meant by that. I was just saying, being a one-bagger in the senior circuit is easy. It's basically the DH of the NL. No one expects you to field, just grab a piece of leather the size of the butt of one of Marge Schott's dogs and pretend like you&rsquo;ve been there before.</p>
