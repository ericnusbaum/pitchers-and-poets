<p>Donald Hall was inevitable for this blog; he's the most famous living baseball poet. <a href="http://dearmrpostman.wordpress.com/">Maggie</a> suggested a poem called Baseball, but I couldn't find it online for semi-legal reproduction on my blog. So here's one called <a href="http://www.bu.edu/agni/poetry/print/2002/56-hall.html">Ninth Inning</a> that I really like. It's long and literary on the dense side, but finish it. The oofh factor is high. and it prominently features a dog.&nbsp; If you doubt his baseball cred, Hall also wrote a biography called <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Dock-Ellis-Country-Baseball-Donald/dp/067165988X">Dock Ellis In The Country Of Baseball</a> that I'd really like to read some day.</p>
<p>1. &nbsp;My dog and I drive five miles every<br />
morning to get the newspaper. How<br />
else do I find out, when the Sox trade<br />
Smoky Joe Wood for Elizabeth Bishop?<br />
He needs persistent demonstration<br />
of love and approval. He cocks his<br />
head making earnest pathetic sounds.<br />
Although I praise his nobility<br />
of soul, he is inconsolable</p>
<p>2. &nbsp;when I lift my hand from his ear to<br />
shift: Even so, after the reading,<br />
the stranger nods, simpers, and offers<br />
to share his poems with me. Dean Gratt<br />
confided, at the annual Death<br />
and Retirement Gala: &ldquo;Professor<br />
McCormick has not changed: A Volvo<br />
is just a Subaru with tenure.&rdquo;<br />
Catchers grow old catching, which is strange</p>
<p>3. &nbsp;because they squat so much. &ldquo;The barn is<br />
burning, O, the barn is burning on<br />
the hill; the cattle low and blunder<br />
in their stalls; the horses scream and hurl<br />
their burning manes.&rdquo; Jennifer remains<br />
melancholic. Do you start to feel,<br />
Kurt, as if you&rsquo;re getting it? I mean<br />
baseball, as in the generations<br />
of old players hanging on, the young</p>
<p>4. &nbsp;coming up from Triple A the first<br />
of September, sitting on the bench<br />
or pinch-running, ready for winter&rsquo;s<br />
snow-plowing and cement-mixing, while<br />
older fellows work out in their gyms<br />
or cellars, like George &ldquo;Shotgun&rsquo;&rsquo; Shuba<br />
who swung a bat against a tethered<br />
ball one thousand times a day, line-drives<br />
underneath his suburban ranchhouse.</p>
<p>5. &nbsp;By 2028, when K. C.<br />
turned one-hundred, eighty-three percent<br />
of American undergraduates<br />
majored in creative writing, more<br />
folks had MFA&rsquo;s than VCR&rsquo;s,<br />
and poetry had passed acrylic<br />
in the GNP. The NEA<br />
offered fellowships for destroying<br />
manuscripts and agreeing: &ldquo;<em>Never</em></p>
<p>6. &nbsp;to publish anything jagged on<br />
the right side of the page, or <em>ever</em><br />
described as &lsquo;prose poems.&rsquo;&rdquo; Guerillas<br />
armed with Word Perfect holed in abstract<br />
redoubts. Chief-of-Staff Vendler mustered<br />
security forces (say: Death Squads)<br />
while she issued comforting reports<br />
nightly on lyric television.<br />
Hideous shepherds sing to their flocks</p>
<p>7. &nbsp;under howling houses of the dog.<br />
At the Temple Medical Center<br />
in New Haven I wait. My mother<br />
at eighty-six goes through the Upper<br />
and Lower GI again. My mind<br />
jangles, thinking of my sick son in<br />
New York and his sick one-year-old girl.<br />
This afternoon, if the X-rays go<br />
all right, I drive back to New Hampshire.</p>
<p>8. &nbsp;In New Hampshire, late August, the leaves<br />
turn slowly, like someone working to<br />
order&mdash;protesting, outraged&mdash;and fall<br />
as they must do. The pond water stays<br />
warm but the campers have departed.<br />
By the railroad goldenrod stiffens;<br />
asters begin a late pennant drive<br />
in front of the barn; pink hollyhocks<br />
wilt and sag like teams out of the race.</p>
<p>9. &nbsp;No Red Sox tonight, but on Friday<br />
a double-header with the Detroit<br />
Tigers, my terrible old team, worse<br />
than the Red Sox who beat the Yankees<br />
last night while my mother and I watched<br />
&mdash;the way we listened, fifty years back&mdash;<br />
sprightly ghosts playing in heavy snow<br />
on VHS 30 from Hartford,<br />
and the pitcher stared at the batter.</p>
