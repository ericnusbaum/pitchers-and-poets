<p>A hypothetical exploration in this week's poem, "Playing Catch," by poet <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Tim_Seibles">Tim Seibles</a>, published in <a href="http://www.pshares.org/issues/article.cfm?prmArticleID=3839">Ploughshares</a>. What if all the world's balls disappeared? What then? How hard will we fall when the crutches are kicked out from under us?:</p>
<p>for Hermann Michaeli</p>
<p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-706" style="margin-left: 2px; margin-right: 2px;" title="tim seibles baseball card" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/tim-seidles-baseball-card1.jpg" alt="tim seibles baseball card" width="242" height="329" />On the day the balls disappeared, men playing soccer<br />
suddenly looked like crazy people chasing invisible<br />
rabbits through the short grass. Men playing baseball<br />
became more clearly what they&rsquo;d always been: bored<br />
teenagers waiting around for something to happen.</p>
<p>Spectators, at home and in the stands, believed<br />
they were being jerked around by a player<br />
conspiracy, that this was the first whimper<br />
of another strike that would cancel all the fun.</p>
<p>On the day the balls disappeared, the sun did not<br />
smear its way up above the dew-damp rooftops as if <em>this</em><br />
were a day to keep your finger on. And if all the umps and refs<br />
overslept that morning, it only meant they were a little extra<br />
tired of instant replay highlighting their best mistakes.</p>
<p>In fact, it was a good Saturday: sunlight the color of a canary&mdash;<br />
everybody was outside! I remember one woman in particular,<br />
alone in the schoolyard practicing lay-ups. Each time<br />
she left the ground she balanced the basketball like<br />
a breakable thing, then let it slip off her long<br />
white fingers toward the rim.</p>
<p>It had been August for more than a month and, as usual,<br />
the televisions were jam-packed with sports: preseason<br />
football, golf, baseball, soccer, some rugby . . . If you didn&rsquo;t<br />
know better watching TV could make you think the world<br />
was really just a million fields separated by a few<br />
rivers and roads&mdash;that life was, in essence, a chance<br />
to love one of the many artificial spheres.</p>
<p>I guess they went all at once or, at least, within<br />
the same fifteen minutes. I had been watching the U.S.<br />
Open Tennis Championships when Pete Sampras, ready<br />
to serve, gestured to the ball boy who quickly<br />
pointed at the other and shrugged, hoping not<br />
to be blamed. People in the stadium began whistling<br />
and stomping their feet. I went to the fridge<br />
and grabbed a plum.</p>
<p>But I remember noticing<br />
a boy and his sister across the street playing catch<br />
in the yard half-framed by my kitchen window.<br />
He had a new red glove. She was a lefty and<br />
brown as coffee, and, just to show off, she whipped<br />
the throw just above his reach.</p>
<p>A moment later<br />
he yelled, <em>I can&rsquo;t find it&mdash;I don&rsquo;t see it&mdash;<br />
it ain&rsquo;t out here</em>! She thought he just wanted her<br />
to go get it, just to get on her nerves. She thought<br />
he was just kidding around.</p>
