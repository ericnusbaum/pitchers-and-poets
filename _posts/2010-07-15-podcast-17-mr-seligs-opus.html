<p>In Podcast 17 we overcome a few sound issues (sorry!) to the discuss hard-throwing-ness of the 2010 All Star Game. Speaking of THROWING HEAT, Ted tells us all about his afternoon in Cooperstown with Bob Feller's 104 MPH Fastball. One thousand is the number of pictures in a giant new book produced by Bud Selig and his front office cohorts about Baseball History -- the next rendition of which will likely include sections on Joey Votto's ornery nature, Rob Neyer's ability to lay down the sac bunt, and deliciousness of Big League Chew.</p>
