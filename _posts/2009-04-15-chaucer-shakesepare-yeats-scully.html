<p>The way Vin Scully talks makes me wonder why I bother to write. Here he is on how Bruce Bochy must have felt watching his Giants get pounded in Monday's Dodger home opener:</p>
<blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">&nbsp;</p>
<p class="MsoNormal"><span><span>I was thinking about Bruce Bochy on Monday, Opening Day, and I was thinking of a line that F. Scott Fitzgerald wrote: &nbsp;'In the real dark night of the soul it&rsquo;s always 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning.' And I was thinking about Bochy in the sunshine on Monday. It was sunshine and daytime to everybody here, but not to the Giants&rsquo; skipper. It was 3 o&rsquo;clock in the morning.</span></span></p>
</blockquote>
<p class="MsoNormal">What will this world be without baseball broadcasters who quote F. Scott Fitzgerald?</p>
