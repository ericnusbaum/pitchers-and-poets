<p>I didn't start keeping score until I was in my Thirties. As a kid, I never had the patience. It's true that I didn't have anyone teach me how to score but my attention was also too scattered for that kind of thing. Occasionally, I would give it a try, because I was envious of my friends who did score games. But it never lasted more than a few innings.</p>
<p>Eventually, I kept a scorecard when I went to Yankee games, using a hybrid of official notations and my own system, which varied from game to game. <del datetime="2011-03-10T17:14:56+00:00">I've always envied those scorebooks with neat, clear handwriting; I'm way too emotional for that.</del>I like the graphic quality of it and look at it like I'm making a collage (I've always envied those scorebooks with neat, clear handwriting; I'm way too emotional for that.) I'm generally a nervous, uptight fan and I discovered that scoring gives me a way to channel my energy and keep me focused on the game. It's almost like knitting. I sit there, clicking on my pen, rolling the corners of the pages, rocking like Leo Mazzone, scribbling little notes, entertaining myself.</p>
<p>These days, you don't need to score to know what's going on, the scoreboards and your cellphones can give you all that information and more, but still, I find it a soothing practice. But I only score at Yankee games. If I'm watching the Mets, and the game doesn't matter to me emotionally, I'll revert back to being a kid, keeping score for a few innings before I get distracted.</p>
<p>I like to think that keeping a scorebook will give me something to enjoy looking back on when I'm old. I rarely revisit them but I don't throw them out either.</p>

<blockquote><p>Alex uses the books from<a href="http://ilovetoscore.com"> ILovetoScore.com</a>, which were designed by a frustrated fan looking for a better way. Kind of a precurser to Bethany Heck's work and definitely worth checking out, if you're into thoughtfully designed scorebooks.</p></blockquote>
