  content: I was unaware of King's disinterest in baseball. Interesting that he played
    at Arkansas with Kevin McReynolds (I think), who famously said one season that
    he didn't care if he made the all-star team because he would prefer to return
    home to Arkansas. McReynolds also played at KC.

  content: If I recall the McReynolds story correctly, his "rather go hunting" quote
    came around the NLCS.

  content: Royal fans were lucky. His 'best' years were as a Royal vice the Bucs.
    However, we long knew of his dislike for baseball. I often wonder how good he
    would've been had he loved the game.

  content: When he played for Pittsburgh he always looked miserable. He never looked
    happy and rarely showed any emotion. I would have surrendered a few body parts
    to be as talented a baseball player as King and he can't get away from the game.
    If you hated it so much Jeff, why did you play in the first place?

  content: Ah, the good ol' days as a Royals fan.  Thank goodness for Jeff's timely
    retirement however.  Joe can back this up, but the Royals were shoping Mike Sweeney
    @ the time because they had no place to play him. If not for Jeff hitting that
    magical pension gate, Sween-dog may be remembered as long term member of the White
    Sox.

    back &amp; spinal pain king experienced &amp; medical minds could not help him
    alleviate. this had to have contributed to his general distaste for the game

  content: Yes, I remember too hearing about the back problems that Jeff King had
    while a Pirate. I also seem to recall that during the 1990 season, Barry Bonds
    not being pleased with Jeff King because I think King had to miss at least one
    or more NLCS games. Bonds basically was questioning King's love of the game.

  content: You assume a lot for not knowing someone. That's why players hate the press,
    and no wonder King hung up on Sweeney's prank call. As someone who knew Jeff King
    once, I know he loved the game. Ever watch him in spring training games? The weight
    of the season pressure was gone, and he loosened up and enjoyed it. It was the
    limelight and big-league pressures he didn't like, in addition to his severe back
    pain. He was a family man too; any of you ever think how hard pro sports are on
    families? The wives of professional athletes spend half the year as single parents,
    and the kids hardly ever see daddy because he gets home late and then has go to
    the ballpark early, if he's not gone on a roadtrip. The cocky, loud-mouthed Barry
    Bonds had it all, fame, money, talent, and he has had two rocky marriages both
    ending in divorce, his oldest son assaulted his own mother and was charged with
    5 misdemeanors, and Bond's entire career is shrouded with steroid scandals. See
    where Bond's "love of baseball" got him? The humble King had a successful, honorable
    career, and is still happily married to the bride of his youth, enjoying life
    with their seven children, by the grace of God. There's so much more to life than
    baseball.

<p>One thing I think about sometimes is how it must feel to be really good at something you don't enjoy doing at all. Take Josh Groban. I obviously don't know Josh Groban but I suspect there's at least a chance that he does not love the kind of music he records. I suspect this because he's not 55 years old. Anyway, maybe he does like his music, maybe he doesn't, but either way he will make many, many, many millions recording these kinds of songs.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3099" title="jeff king portrait" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/jeff-king-portrait.png" alt="" width="317" height="396" />Best I could tell, <a title="jeff king baseball reference" href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/k/kingje01.shtml">Jeff King</a> did not like playing baseball. I can never remember seeing a player who seemed so miserable on a baseball diamond. King was a near-legendary player at Arkansas, where he twice tied the school record for home runs, and he was the first pick of the 1986 draft. He had a pretty good career in the big leagues. His numbers would have looked better in a lower-scoring era, but even in his era he did hit 24-plus homers three times, he drove in 110 RBIs in back-to-back years, and he was a very good defensive first baseman, as converted third baseman often are. He was nimble enough to have played 11 games at shortstop early in his career.</p>
<p>But I'm not kidding about how much he disliked the game. His manager in Kansas City, Tony Muser, used to tell a story about how he heard King moaning one day about the National Anthem. Muser, a former Marine, was shocked but King explained: "Every time they play this song, I have a bad day." King hit 30 home runs and 36 doubles in 1996, his best year, and followed with 28 homers, 30 doubles and 89 walks in Kansas City in 1987, but he generally looked like he would rather be anyplace else on earth.</p>
<p>On May 21, 1999 Jeff King suddenly and shockingly retired. He seemed healthy, and he seemed to be having a reasonably successful year -- he was on a little six-game hitting streak at the time. It didn't make a lot of sense ... unless you realized how much he despised playing professional baseball. He couldn't wait to get out. Later someone told me that he had, only the day before he retired, secured enough service time to guarantee his MLB pension. With that, he went off to a ranch in Wyoming or some such place.</p>
<p>One postscript: King's replacement at first base was a pretty good player named Mike Sweeney who would go on to have several spectacular years for the Royals and make five All-Star teams. He is also one of the great guys ever so he used to check in on King. Once, for fun, he called King and said: "Hi Jeff, this is Joe Posnanski from the Kansas City Star I just wanted to ask you a few baseball questions ..."</p>
<p>And Jeff King hung up on him.</p>
