<p><em><strong>Jesse Thorn</strong> is a prominent voice in the world of men's style via his blog <a title="put this on jesse thorn" href="http://putthison.com/">Put This On</a>. He is also&nbsp;the host of the public radio show The Sound of Young America, and co-host of the Jordan, Jesse Go! podcast, both of which can be found on his web site, <a title="maximum fun jesse thorn" href="http://www.maximumfun.org/">MaximumFun.org</a>. He chose to highlight the work of <strong>Mark Grace</strong>.</em></p>

The best first basemen have a certain grace. They may be slow (which Grace certainly was), but they shouldn't be lumbering. Grace was smooth and elegant both at the plate and around the bag, rarely made mistakes and had the most hits in the majors during the decade.</p>
