    working. (And I really want to see it.)

  content: "Oh, and Prezi is a presentation tool. Basically, it's hipster powerpoint:
    it serves essentially the same purpose, only with less functionality and more
    style (of dubious merit).\r\n\r\nI recommend clicking on the \"more -> fullscreen\"
    option. Then you can just walk through it with your left and right arrow keys.
    If you do it right, Jose Canseco should flip you off at least twice."

<p>I once got Jose Canseco's autograph on a baseball at Tropicana Field. He was playing catch with Bubba Trammell when I called out 'Mr. Canseco, Mr. Canseco' and he turned and grinned. The year was 1999. Although his role that season was technically 'designated hitter,' Jose Canseco caught the baseball I threw to him. He walked toward me. He signed the baseball with so much force that his signature became engraved in the sweet spot. I said thank you. The felt tip of my sharpie was pushed inward and rendered useless. Jose Canseco hit seven home runs that night -- he would go on to hit 34 that season. The next day, Wade Boggs crushed my baseball with his teeth and washed it down with Budweiser.  </p>
