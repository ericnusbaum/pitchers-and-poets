<p>Poem Of The Week: The Crowd At The Ball Game By William Carlos Williams</p>
<p>The crowd at the ball game<br />
is moved uniformly</p>
<p>by a spirit of uselessness<br />
which delights them &mdash;</p>
<p>all the exciting detail<br />
of the chase</p>
<p>and the escape, the error<br />
the flash of genius &mdash;</p>
<p>all to no end save beauty<br />
the eternal -</p>
<p>So in detail they, the crowd,<br />
are beautiful</p>
<p>for this<br />
to be warned against</p>
<p>saluted and defied &mdash;<br />
It is alive, venomous</p>
<p>it smiles grimly<br />
its words cut &mdash;</p>
<p>The flashy female with her<br />
mother, gets it &mdash;</p>
<p>The Jew gets it straight - it<br />
is deadly, terrifying &mdash;</p>
<p>It is the Inquisition, the<br />
Revolution</p>
<p>It is beauty itself<br />
that lives</p>
