<p style="text-align: left;">Today's the day of the big <a href="http://roguesbaseballindex.com">Rogue's Baseball Index</a> relaunch.&nbsp; Below is the text of our intro post over there:</p>
<blockquote><p>Welcome to the new and improved Rogue's Baseball Index blog. When we unveiled the RBI in September, it was as a Wiki, a browse-able dictionary with no practical uses and without even its own domain name. Today the RBI is reborn as a blog. It's still baseball like you've already thought it, only this time it's delivered to your doorstep (or RSS Feeder) every day. Check in  for new terms every Monday, Wednesday, and Friday, and archived gems on Tuesdays and Thursdays. The wiki will also still available for your perusing pleasure.</p>
<p>If you're still not quite sure what this is all about, you can visit our <a href="http://www.roguesbaseballindex.com/about-2/">About Page</a>. But here's the main idea: The Rogue&rsquo;s Baseball Index (or RBI for short) is what we have deemed an <em>alternative baseball lexicon</em>: it&rsquo;s a baseball dictionary, if Merriam was <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/www.thedeadballera.com');" href="http://www.thedeadballera.com/BeerDrinkersKingKelly.html">Mike &ldquo;King&rdquo; Kelly</a> and Webster was <a onclick="javascript:pageTracker._trackPageview('/outbound/article/www.baseballreliquary.org');" href="http://www.baseballreliquary.org/lee.htm">Bill &ldquo;Spaceman&rdquo; Lee</a>. It's brought to you by Ted Walker and Eric Nusbaum, the guys behind Pitchers &amp; Poets. We'll also have regular contributions from Carson Cistulli. Artwork and Design are by <a href="http://markpenxa.com">Mark Penxa</a> and Kolin Pope.</p>
