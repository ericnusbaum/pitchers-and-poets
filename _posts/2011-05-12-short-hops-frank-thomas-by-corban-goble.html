The first baseman of the &rsquo;90s was definitely Frank Thomas and it really wasn&rsquo;t because I got to watch him play&mdash;I honestly don&rsquo;t remember watching many baseball games growing up. I vaguely remember his Nike shoes being somewhat boss. But what I do remember, solidly, is that the Big Hurt had one of the huge circles in Ken Griffey Jr. Baseball for Nintendo 64&mdash;only eight in the game had a huge circle and Thomas was the only first baseman&mdash;so that&rsquo;s what seals it for me.</p>
