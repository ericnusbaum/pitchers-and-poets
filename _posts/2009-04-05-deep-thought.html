  content: "Wow. That's a tough one. However, I imagine we'll all forget about PEDs
    and move on at some point. Hope springs eternal and all that.\r\n\r\nMeanwhile,
    Joe Morgan et. al. at the WWL are alienating everyone with ears to hear their
    commentary. There are games I'd rather not watch than sit and listen to those
    folks for 3+ hours."
