<p>We don't do too much self-promotion here on Pitchers &amp; Poets, but sometimes it's necessary. &nbsp;And as our traffic grows -- which it has quite a bit in 2011, thank you new readers! -- we hope that you follow the site in all its other iterations on other platforms.</p>
<p>We also hope that you tell your friends about P&amp;P --the content and the podcast. We appreciate it a great deal when people spread the word. Now is a good time to do it, too, because next week we will be celebrating something everybody loves, <strong>First Basemen of the 1990s</strong>, with the help of many good friends. &nbsp;With that in mind:</p>
