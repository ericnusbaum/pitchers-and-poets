  content: "The New York Times thing on Ruth was fantastic. I love that footage.\r\n\r\nThe
    mural is really nice too. And as for Stuart Shea, all I can say is: He is trying
    to forge in the smithy of his soul the consciousness of the pennant race."

<p><em>Postseason play is heating up big-time. In the baseball season's transition from endings to beginnings, a number of people around the game have looked back a ways in this past week:</em></p>
<ul>
<li>Artist Thom Ross is on a mission of unforgetting. In this case, he's toting his mural of the famous Willie Mays catch to the scene of its enactment: he and friends placed the installation on the exact spot that the catch was made. <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2009/writers/the_bonus/09/24/thom.ross/1.html">SI.com</a></li>
<li>Recently undiscovered home video footage of Babe Ruth at the bat confirms that he took his sweet time about it.&nbsp;<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2009/10/09/sports/baseball/09video.html?ref=sports">New York Times</a></li>
<li>Fangraph's Dave Cameron ensures surly Cards fans that Thursday's loss wasn't all Matt Holliday's fault. <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/nlds-coverage-dont-blame-holliday">Fangraphs</a></li>
<li>Paul DePodesta reminds us of the trials and the tears of a career in baseball's front office.&nbsp;<a href="http://itmightbedangerous.blogspot.com/2009/10/last-week.html">It Might Be Dangerous</a></li>
<li>Stuart Shea offers a poem to the soon-to-move-on. <a href="http://bardball.com/goodnight-and-good-luck/">Bardball</a></li>
</ul>
