  content: Even as I began bisecting already bisected columns and rows in order to
    fit all the substitutions <- ! Do you remember how you handled the batting around?
    Bisecting the columns? Marginalia? Were there 10th/11th inning or box score total
    columns you could coopt?

  content: "I recall pushing everything over an inning (turning the 10th into the
    9th, and so on), as I'm pretty sure the scorecard had a 10th.  Fortunately the
    game didn't go to extras, so that didn't become a problem.\r\n\r\nThe problem,
    really, was not that the game was impossible to score, but rather that I was essentially
    learning how to keep score as it happened, and so I was making mistakes all over
    the place, devising schemes for how to make it clear that Dante Bichette didn't
    get an RBI for Eric Young's steal of home (despite hitting a home run right afterwards),
    and generally fouling things up.  Hence the arrows pointing to inning markers:
    I'm sure (because I still have this habit) that I would sometimes jump innings
    when going from the bottom of the order to the top, meaning I'd have to go back
    and use space from earlier innings later on."

<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/scorekeeping-week-inset.png" alt="" /><em>Paul Franz is a Rockies fan, an educator, and recurring P&P contributor. Welcome to Scorekeeping Week..end. His blog is <a href="http://nichtdiesetone.blogspot.com/">Nicht DIese Tone </a>.</em></p>
<p>"The end of pitching as we know it."&nbsp; That's how SportsCenter would  describe the game , in their typically overwrought tones.&nbsp;  Still, to a grade-school-aged Rockies fan like me, it was monumental  enough that a game I attended <em>in person</em> was leading the venerable ESPN program, much less in biblical - or at least Hollywoodical - tones.</p>
<p>The game in question was a 16-15 affair between the Rockies and Dodgers.&nbsp;  It took place on <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/COL/COL199606300.shtml" target="_blank">June 30, 1996</a>,  just days after my 11th birthday.&nbsp; We attended - my family and I - as  my present for the year.&nbsp; Because I was a huge nerd as a kid,* I  insisted on keeping score.&nbsp; Where I learned to keep score is a question I  can't answer, as my dad is nearly blind and can't follow the game, my  mom knows next to nothing about baseball, and my brother is younger than  me and not particularly a baseball fan.&nbsp; At the time I knew the  principles of scorekeeping, but had never done it for a whole game.&nbsp; And, hey, at 11 I reasoned it was about time I graduated from  theory to practice.</p>
<p><em>* As in, when I was a kid my brother and I would play fake  baseball games with stuffed animals and matchbox cars.&nbsp; That's not the  nerdy part.&nbsp; The nerdy part is that, while my brother moved the  "players" around and generally executed the actions of the game, I  actually kept track of the statistics - batting averages, home runs,  ERAs, and so on - of the toys involved.&nbsp; I had literally notebooks full  of this stuff, all from when I was around six or seven.&nbsp; So yeah, nerdy.</em></p>
<p>Needless to say, the decision to keep score for this particular game  would prove disastrous.&nbsp; Besides the final score of 16-15 (guaranteed  to produce a messy scorebook), the Rockies used six pitchers and stole  ten bases.&nbsp; The Dodgers' Hideo Nomo gave up nine runs (only five earned)  in five innings.&nbsp;<ins datetime="2011-03-12T18:45:52+00:00">This was my birthday, dammit, and I was keeping score no matter the consequences.</ins> Indeed, the experience was so traumatic for Nomo - as  he and Piazza combined to allow the bulk of the stolen bases, including  all 6 of Eric Young's - that he threw a no-hitter in <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/COL/COL199609170.shtml" target="_blank">his next Coors Field start</a>.&nbsp;  Perhaps a less determined young man - or a smarter one, anyway - would  have given up after the Dodgers batted around in the third inning,  necessitating jumping into the next inning on the scoresheet.&nbsp; But I was  exceedingly, bull-headedly, determined.&nbsp; This was my birthday, dammit,  and I was keeping score no matter the consequences.&nbsp; Even as I began  bisecting already bisected columns and rows in order to fit all the  substitutions, I persevered.</p>
<p>For whatever reason, of the many pieces of childhood  paraphernalia my parents kept, this scorecard was not one of them. It could not possibly have seemed significant to them.&nbsp;  It likely would have seemed an incomprehensible mess even  to someone familiar with such things, thanks to the many divided cells  and arrows mapping events to their proper innings.&nbsp; Still, despite the  necessary mess - and my less-than-stellar 5th grade handwriting - it  would be fascinating to see now.</p>
<p><del datetime="2011-03-12T18:45:52+00:00">Sometimes the simple, elegantly designed  structures we use to understand, categorize, and generally record our  experience of the world cannot cope with the complexity of reality in  action</del>In retrospect, there's a lesson in my scorekeeping experience - if I  may pontificate for a moment.&nbsp; Sometimes the simple, elegantly designed  structures we use to understand, categorize, and generally record our  experience of the world cannot cope with the complexity of reality in  action.&nbsp; Not all baseball games are tidy 3-2 affairs.&nbsp; Faced with  reality, then, we have the option of building more complex, but less  aesthetic structures to house our understand in, or we can continue to  hope the simple and elegant will serve often enough that it remains  desirable.</p>
<p>Unfortunately, in this age of technocracy and commodity, we too  often pick the robust over the beautiful, forgetting that there is a  very different story one might tell about those times when the simple,  elegant, minimalist scorecard confronts 16 to 15.&nbsp; The experience wasn't  disastrous, the scorecard not a hideous mess after all in this  different account.&nbsp; It was, instead, elegant in its own way, and heroic  besides.&nbsp; A baseball game <em>ought</em> to fit onto a simple scorecard,  perhaps, but if it does not, it is up to the scorer not to invent a new,  more convoluted, more sophisticated model, but rather to see, behind  all the runs and runes, substitutions and symbols, the stolen bases, the  errors, and the five-run innings that it is still baseball that is  being played.&nbsp; Even that little, inadequate scorecard, all chaos and  chicken-scratch, is perfect for the job.</p>
