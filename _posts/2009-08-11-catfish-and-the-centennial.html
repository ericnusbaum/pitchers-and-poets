  content: "Thanks all. For my part, I'm glad to have jumped onto this steamwagon
    when I did (you should see the hefty bonus Eric pushed my way for helping to get
    us to 100).\r\n\r\nAnd thanks Mary, that Tom Paxton song is a great one, I'll
    work on it."

<p style="text-align: left;">As of today Pitchers &amp; Poets has enough posts for somebody (like&nbsp; VH1 or Pitchfork or&nbsp; Time Magazine or the Modern Library Association) to create a definitive and Important list of the&nbsp; Top 100 Pitchers &amp; Poets posts. Indeed this very collection of words that you are reading right now is the blog's 100th post. It's very cool to write that, to reach that A-ball milestone, as I had very tempered expectations in terms of not just audience, but the quality and consistency of the content when i started this blog. Thanks to Ted for coming out of nowhere to simultaneously challenge me, spell me, and reign me in with his writing.&nbsp; And thanks to you guys for reading, or at the very least pretending to.</p>

<p style="text-align: left;">Your reward is an update to the Baseball Mixtape. This one's a cover of Bob Dylan's classic bootleg Catfish. This version, performed by a Miami blues artist named <a href="http://www.myspace.com/albertcastiglia">Albert Castiglia</a>, has a kind of heavier, soul-oozing vibe. Ted, who dug this up somehow, says there is a Dr. John-ness too it. I'll agree with that and mention my first reaction: it puts me in a swampy southern minor league ballpark on a hot summer night. Enjoy.</p>
