<p><img class="alignleft" title="Best American Sports Writing 2010 cover" src="http://www.roguesbaseballindex.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/08/basw2010.png" alt="" width="182" height="270" />Pitchers and Poets was unknown to me back in 2009, when I came across a beautiful, haunting piece of writing about a dead young pitcher and a family's tribute on the baseball field, <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2009/03/18/the-death-of-a-pitcher/#comments">The Death of a Pitcher</a>. The piece's author, a heady young upstart named Eric Nusbaum, was taking the game of baseball in his hands like a wet glob of clay, slapping it onto the wheel and forming it into something dense and glowing, and I knew it.</p>
<p>Well, I wasn't the only one to take notice. Others out there, the taste-makers of the sports writing establishment, found Nusbaum's blip on the radar as I did. They felt the same chill when they read about Jaime Irogoyen's passing, and about a community's need for the game. And the taste-makers acted.</p>
<p>Now, I am proud as hell to announce the coolest thing ever:</p>
<p><span style="font-weight: normal;"><em>Glenn Stout, series editor of The Best American Sports Writing anthology, and this year's guest editor, Peter Gammons (!), have </em></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><em>selected</em></span><span style="font-weight: normal;"><em> Eric Nusbaum's piece, "The Death of a Pitcher," to appear in this year's edition, The Best American Sports Writing 2010.</em></span></p>
<p>Eric works his tail off for this blog. He works his tail off to create engaging stories, and he's a pleasure to work with. I couldn't be happier that he's been picked for such a substantial collection of writers and writing. He deserves it.</p>
<p>The edition is <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-American-Sports-Writing-2010/dp/0547152485">available for pre-order</a> on Amazon, releasing on September 28, 2010. Check out the entire lineup of writers and work on <a href="http://www.indiepro.com/glenn/?page_id=59">Stout's blog</a>.</p>
