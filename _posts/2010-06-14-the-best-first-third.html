  content: Good point. It really has been a great season so far. And its shaping up
    to have some excellent races. Every single division has teams 2.5 games out or
    less. Should be a nice summer.

  content: Thanks for the comments. I can't believe I missed Heyward. Regarding gossip...I
    see what you mean but I still consider the stories I listed above newsy. Especially
    Junior's retirement.

  content: Heyward, for sure. Mike Stanton could even be thrown in there with his
    minors stats. The struggles of last year's Cy Young winners, Lincecum and Greinke.
    And one of the oddest, all the trouble with Phillies fans....vomiting on eachother,
    getting tazed, children drinking beer. This has been a great season and I can't
    wait to follow all the tight races as Paul pointed out.

  content: "I feel like the last few years, MLB has always posted some end-of-year
    roundup about how awesome and unique the year was.\r\n\r\nAnd to a point, they're
    right--they /are/ awesome seasons--but I'm not sure how to pick and choose between
    them."

  content: I feel like many seasons of yore may have been as story-filled or exciting,
    but the 24-hour news cycle just hadn't yet been invented. The only stories that
    would have been really big in the past would have been the perfectos and the blown
    call. Still, I've been sated by this season--it's been damn exciting. Let's just
    slow the hyperbole train down.

  content: "This is a ridiculous post. MLB seasons aren't spoken or thought of in
    thirds, to start with. Such a \"mark\" smacks of desperation.\r\nThe pitching
    stories are fascinating so far -- maybe that should have been the focus. After
    all, Milton Bradley going nuts is an annual story.\r\nAnother annual story that
    is so boring no one talks much about it: Roy Halladay is leading the league in
    complete games. He's done it five times before, including the season he broke
    his leg and made only 19 starts. He just turned 33 years old, yet he is the MLB
    active leader in complete games, finishing 54 of his 300 starts (18%). Number
    two is Livan Hernandez, who has finished 48 of 424 (11%). Jamie Moyer is third
    (33/621=5.3%). Wakefield is fourth (32/431=7.4%). \r\nHalladay has five complete
    games already this year, and it's only June. That's quite a story in an age of
    pitch counts and one-inning closers."

  content: "Thanks for the comments. \r\n\r\nEmber, Why must you be so level-headed?\r\n\r\n\r\nAndy,
    I think the Griffey story is big in any season, and possibly the Strasburg story
    too. You make a fair point about the news cycle, though. \r\n\r\nTerry, I'm not
    sure what's desperate here. I'm excited about the baseball season we've had so
    far. I imagine you arrived here via Rob Neyer's link. If you keep reading PnP
    -- and I hope you do -- you will learn that we aren't in the business of creating
    stories where they ain't, providing timely analysis, or writing lists just to
    build up traffic. We just enjoy baseball a hell of a lot.\r\n\r\nAs far as the
    pitching stories -- yes they are fascinating. And yes Roy Halladay is amazing.
    \ I actually wrote about complete games about a year ago:\r\n\r\nhttp://pitchersandpoets.com/2009/04/22/the-decline-and-fall-of-the-complete-game/"

<p>It occurred to me the other day that this might be the most story-filled first third to a season ever. Consider how much excitement has already been packed into the year:</p>
<ul>
<li>A no-hitter by Ubaldo Jimenez, who happens to be 12-1 with an ERA so small you can barely see it.</li>
<li>Arguably he worst call in the history of sports, and certainly the most memorably botched&nbsp; call in regular season baseball history by Jim Joyce costs Armando Galarraga a perfect game on the 27th out.</li>
<li>Perfect games by baseball's best and angriest pitchers respectively in Roy Halladay and Dallas Braden</li>
<li>The hilarious drama between the aforementioned Braden and Alex Rodriguez</li>
<li>The accusation that all-time great&nbsp; Ken Griffey Jr slept through a pinch-hit opportunity followed weeks later by his quiet retirement</li>
<li>Griffey teammate Milton Bradley exits the&nbsp; Mariner clubhouse mid-game.</li>
<li>Strasburgmania enters</li>
<li>Jose Lima exits</li>
<li>And all the other stuff I missed</li>
</ul>
<p>See how much has happened? So tell me. Are these the most exciting two and a half months to ever open a baseball season, or is my giddiness unfounded?</p>
