<p><img class="alignleft" src="http://passionweiss.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/mixtape.jpg" alt="" width="185" height="117" />I resisted putting this song on there because somehow it has come to represent everything obnoxious about the Red Sox. But there's nothing I can do to avoid the fact that like some women from Boston, it was easily available for free download. So Tessie, welcome to the Mixtape. Make sure you check out the Mixtape page, the sidebar, or the stealthy music player in the bottom left hand corner of your screen. </p>
