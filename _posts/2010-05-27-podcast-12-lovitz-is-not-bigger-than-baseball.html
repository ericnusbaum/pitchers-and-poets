  content: "Perhaps the Astros' irrational love of Geoff Blum derives from seeing
    him at the pinnacle (remember *those* baseball cards?) moment of his career.  That
    being hitting the game winning home run for my beloved White Sox in game 3 of
    the '05 World Series in the top of the 14th.  Thus elevating him from obscurity
    in White Sox history to mid-level obscurity. \r\n\r\nAs for players who keep showing
    up on the White Sox it's hard to say because they turned over a large portion
    of the roster this year.  Though certainly Scott Linebrink would make the list.
    \ In the past it was post-2005 Juan Uribe.  And this year I can already tell in
    the future it's going to be Mark Teahen."

  content: "Juan Uribe seems like a natural for the role. It's amazing how a player
    who is purportedly 'versatile' can use that to veil their mediocrity.\r\n\r\nAs
    for Blum, I think you're right. It's the same reason that the Cardinals would
    never touch Brad Lidge with a ten foot pole."

  content: "If I were a GM of the Mariners or the Mets for a day, my \"Geoff Blum
    insta-cuts\" would be: \r\n\r\nJose Lopez and Jeff Francoeur. Both of them need
    to go to walking school, badly.\r\n\r\nI would miss Jose Lopez running/scurrying
    around the bases however."

  content: "Lopez is DQed, Kenneth, sorry: these have to be players that you utterly
    despise on every level. You can't like them even in an ironic or goofy sense.
    If there's anything you'd miss about them (as I said, even ironically), they're
    out. Francoeur seems like a good candidate.\r\n\r\nBy the way, thanks for listening,
    guys!"

    Jack Nicholson story with the world. I tell everyone who will listen."

  content: I was about to argue that Chris Young is disqualified from the name/syllable
    contest because Chris is short for Christopher. Then it hit me that Geoff is short
    for Geoffrey.
