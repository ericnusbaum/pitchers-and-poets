  content: 'Of note:  if Ricky Henderson had actually been the poet who created this
    piece, it would not have been called "The Base Stealer" but rather:  "The Stolen
    Baser."'

<p>Ricky Henderson was inducted into the Hall of Fame this weekend. We didn't necessarily mean to ignore that fact (or Jim Rice's induction), but we have. So PnP makes amends to Ricky the best way we know how.&nbsp; This&nbsp; work by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Francis_%28poet%29">Robert Francis</a>, a student of Robert Frost, captures the tension of a stolen base like only poetry and Ricky Henderson can. And unlike Ricky's career, it's quite short:</p>
<blockquote><p><span style="font-family: Verdana;"><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-737" title="robert francis card" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/07/robert-francis-card.jpg" alt="robert francis card" width="194" height="264" />Poised between going on and back, pulled<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Both ways taut like a tight-rope walker,<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Fingertips pointing the opposites,<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Now bouncing tiptoe like a dropped ball,<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Or a kid skipping rope, come on, come on!<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Running a scattering of steps sidewise,<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">How he teeters, skitters, tingles, teases,<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Taunts them, hovers like an ecstatic bird,<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">He's only flirting, crowd him, crowd him,<br />
</span><span style="font-family: Verdana;">Delicate, delicate, delicate, delicate - Now!</span></p></blockquote>
