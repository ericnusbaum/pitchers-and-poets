<p>&lsquo;Soccer Is Ruining America&rsquo; <a href="http://www.firstthings.com/onthesquare/?p=1329">says Steven Webb over at First Things</a>, it corrupts our youth. The answer? More Baseball. He's really serious, and Britain is <a href="http://www.spectator.co.uk/alexmassie/3432866/americas-crazy-war-on-soccer.thtml">none too pleased</a>. (h/t on all this to <a href="http://dailydish.typepad.com">Andrew Sullivan</a>.) Everybody just needs to look to Nomar and Mia.</p>
<p>A father <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101751613">on NPR</a> wonders if the steroid era will <a href="http://www.npr.org/templates/story/story.php?storyId=101751613">somehow contaminate</a> the apple pie innocence of his son&rsquo;s passion for baseball. Apparently oblivious to baseball&rsquo;s history of corruption, racism, labor abuses, and other generally wily misbehavior. (h/t <a href="http://www.hardballtimes.com/main/shysterball/article/wont-somebody-think-of-the-children/">Shysterball</a>).</p>
<p>Josh Wilker at the painfully-honest-perspective-on existential-questions-factory <a href="http://cardboardgods.net/2009/03/12/cardboard-links-31209/#more-3431">Cardboard Gods</a>: <em>What a grim one-direction-only conveyor belt is life!</em></p>
<p>Also, feel free to go back and read Tuesday's <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/?p=76">poem of the wee</a>k. It's got some childhood baseball action going on. </p>
<p><strong>Bonus Material: The young and the very old. </strong></p>
<p>Michael Phelps calls certain unnamed <a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/oly/news/story?id=3974937">youthful indiscretion</a> &lsquo;bad mistake.&rsquo; No word on whether he was referring to the bong or the fact that there was a camera in the room.</p>
<p>92-year old Senator Robert Byrd, is on Twitter and apparently in the hands of a <a href="http://twitter.com/RobertByrd/status/1308056713">powerful jelly bean lobby</a>. (Editor&rsquo;s note: this blog is <a href="http://twitter.com/pitchersnpoets">on twitter too</a>, but only just barely).</p>
