<p>2.	<a href="http://jonahkeri.com">Jonah Keri</a> published a link this morning to George Plimpton&rsquo;s legendary April Fools story <a href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2003/magazine/09/26/plimpton.finch/">The Curious Case Of Sidd Finch</a>. I read it when I was 12ish in a book of collected baseball writing from Sports Illustrated that my parents gave me. These were the days before internet killed my attention span and fate determined that I would never have a reliable permanent address, so I read every issue of SI all the way through. Anyway, Sidd Finch is all I remember from that book. The story was unbelievable, yet I believed every word of it for at least a couple of years. The story is a pleasure to read, and you'll probably come to the same conclusion I have The only person trickier and more clever than Geroge Plimpton was his animated Simpsons self:</p>
