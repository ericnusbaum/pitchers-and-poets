  content: "Very enjoyable listening, I must say. It felt like a very natural conversation;
    which is the most important part of a podcast to me. Another plus was that neither
    of your melodious, soothing voices grated on my ears like Dave Cameron's or Matthew
    Berry's.\r\n\r\nOne suggestion for future podcasts would be to give a primer or
    brief description in the post of what topics you will be discussing."

  content: Great debut - you guys make a great team.. 2 thoughts... narrative matters
    because we need to know who to bet on in Vegas and why the obsession with fantasy
    baseball?  2 words - fantasy and baseball!  Just kidding but really enjoyed the
    podcast and looking forward to hearing future ones.  I agree with Kenneth, you
    both have great radio voices

  content: "Good job, guys.  I'll second Kenneth's comment--you both were very natural-sounding.
    \ \r\n\r\nEric-- Be sure to reference little league experiences from this season
    after we start.\r\n\r\nTed-- I don't know you, but you sound like a cool guy to
    talk baseball with. \r\n\r\nLooking forward to your next cast."

  content: "I enjoyed and agree with just about everything the two of you discussed
    (apart from Eric's misguided \"jumping into the lake\" metaphor).\r\n\r\nRegarding
    baseball books, I recently read 'Satchel' by Larry Tye, the first baseball book
    I've touched in a long time, and I loved it. It fits into the exact category you
    described, I enjoyed it because I knew nothing of his career so the mysteries
    of Satchel Paige as a character were able to play out.\r\n\r\nGreat work.\r\n\r\nPS.
    Eric, if I borrowed your copy of 'My Favorite Summer 1956' to read when when I
    was 12, I have it if you ever want it back."
