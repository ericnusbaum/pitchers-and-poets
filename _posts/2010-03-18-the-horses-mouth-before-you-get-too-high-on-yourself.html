<blockquote>This is not rotisserie league baseball or anything like that. We've got to take roster status, contractual status, service time, everything into consideration to try to make the right decision both for now and the long term.  - Ed Wade</p></blockquote>
<p>The general manager of the most <a href="http://www.fangraphs.com/blogs/index.php/organizational-rankings-30-houston-astros">peed-upon</a> team in the bigs right now wants you to <a href="http://www.chron.com/disp/story.mpl/sports/bb/6918244.html">know</a> that he's thinking about, you know, <em>things</em>. Things that take into account other things, and things that you aren't thinking about because you're having too much fun with your little "games."</p>
