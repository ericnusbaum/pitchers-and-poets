  content: Young Roy Oswalt has a batting eye after my own heart. Very impressive.

<p><img class="alignright" src="http://www.roguesbaseballindex.com/wp-content/uploads/2010/04/killerbeeslogo.jpg" alt="" width="258" height="339" /><em>Along with three friends, I am coaching a Little League team of seven, eight, and nine year olds. All four of us are in our early twenties. Needless to say, we are the only coaches in the league without kids of our own. Our goal? Utter domination. Throughout the season I will keep Pitchers &amp; Poets readers updated on the goings on surrounding the team. </em></p>
<p>Our season is almost over. Before the final wrap-up post, I thought I'd post some interesting statistical notes sent by coach/statistician Kenneth:</p>
<ul>
<li> Young Roy Oswalt has come up to the plate 25 times this year and has walked or struck out 24 times. He gets a free pass in 60% of his trips to the plate, the best rate on the team.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Young Shawn Green has 8 of our 18 extra base hits this year (you could probably write an entire post with his more impressive tidbits...*</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li>Young Joe Mauer and Young Craig Biggio both have 11 hits, but Biggio has 18 RBI while Mauer only has 4.</li>
</ul>
<ul>
<li> Past two starts by Dottie Hinson: 4 IP, 10 K's, 6 BB's, 0 Runs, 49 total pitches.</li>
</ul>
<p>*Young Shawn Green has a slash line of .700/.769/2.019. On Balls in Play, his batting average is an even more insane .870.</p>
