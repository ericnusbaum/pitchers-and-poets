<p>This <a href="http://www.pbs.org/newshour/bb/poems/july-dec98/pinsky_10-6.html">semi-divine poem</a> by Gail Mazure celebrates the Red Sox and hope and honors fellow poet <a href="http://www.poets.org/jtate/">James Tate</a>. It encapsulates the fallibility of baseball and the futility of a fan watching or listening but not playing. When you're done, <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poet.html?id=4491">check out Mazure</a>, who's written more than one great baseball poem in her day...</p>
<blockquote><p>This morning I argued with a friend<br />
about angels. I didn't believe<br />
in his belief in them-- I cannot<br />
believe they're not a metaphor.<br />
Our argument, affectionate,<br />
lacking an animus, went nowhere.<br />
We promised to talk again soon.<br />
Now, when I'm driving away<br />
from Boston and the Red Sox<br />
are losing, I hear the announcer<br />
say, 'No angels in the sky today' -<br />
baseball-ese for a cloudless afternoon,<br />
no shadows to help a man<br />
who waits in the outfield<br />
staring into the August sun.<br />
Although I know the announcer's<br />
not a rabbi or a sage (no,<br />
he's a sort of sage, disconsolate<br />
philosopher of batting slumps<br />
and injuries), still, I scan<br />
the pale blue sky through my<br />
polarized windshield, fervently<br />
hopeful for my fading team<br />
and I feel something a little<br />
foolish, a prayerful throbbing<br />
in my throat, and remember<br />
being told years ago that men<br />
are only little lower<br />
than the angels. Floating ahead of me<br />
at the Vermont border, I see<br />
a few wispy, horse mane clouds<br />
which I quietly pray will drift<br />
down to Fenway Park, where<br />
a demonic opponent has just<br />
slammed another Red Sox pitch,<br />
and the centerfielder - call him 'Jim' -<br />
runs back, back, back,<br />
looking heavenward,<br />
and is shielded and doesn't lose<br />
the white ball in the glare.</p></blockquote>
