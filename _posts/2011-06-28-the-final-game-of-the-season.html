  content: Not often you hear of the batter getting a save in a game.  Well done.

<p>It was the sort of field you would expect to see behind an elementary school: the ferrous chain-link backstop, splotches of crabgrass masking divots in the clay.&nbsp; The playground, ordinarily teeming with playful shrieks and children&rsquo;s arguments, today fell silent; the wind brushed the leaves of the trees lazily in the summer sun.&nbsp; In front of the backstop, the earth had worn down by a hundred children digging their toes into the earth, emulating their favorite heroes.&nbsp; The rubber bases were placed in rough approximation, second base located perhaps a shade too close to third, the diamond more of a rhombus.&nbsp; I leaned forward into the stretch, rolling the white plastic wiffleball between my fingers, shaking off a nonexistent catcher.&nbsp; The six year-old boy fidgeted the oversized orange bat, tense with waiting.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-3800" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/06/28/the-final-game-of-the-season/back/"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3800" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/back.jpg" alt="" width="432" height="324" /></a></p>
<p>Between classes and readings for graduate school, I spend my time with a before and after school program at a nearby grade school.&nbsp; Ordinarily, there are twenty or thirty children, but today is the last day of school, a half-day, and most of the parents have come early to pick up their children and begin their summer vacations.&nbsp; For the handful that remains, only I and six hours stand between them and their freedom.</p>
<p>We play with rules that have been engraved in the rules of the sandlot since ages past: the pitcher&rsquo;s hand, the ghost runner.&nbsp; Children lead off despite my warnings, and I whip my arm in a fake throwing motion, sending them sprawling back to the bag.&nbsp; There are no walks, and five strikes to a batter, and too many times I have to remind the younger boys and girls not to stand on the plate.&nbsp; We track the runs, not because anyone is keeping score, but because the teams switch sides after five runs are scored; without gloves and with the tentative fingers of first basemen, outs are rare.<br />
<!--more--> The innings and the hours pass.&nbsp; Occasionally, my phone will ring and a child will be sent to their waiting parents; otherwise I continue with my rubber arm.&nbsp; Years of pitching wiffleballs have honed my skills, and nearly every pitch I throw is a graceful, twelve-six curve at the knees, the kind that would make Tewksbury proud.&nbsp; I mix in an occasional Quisenberry or a Sewell, but the batters refuse to swing.&nbsp; They tell me to pitch normal.&nbsp; I throw a fastball by them, and grin, and they snarl with sharp little teeth.</p>
<p>Eventually there are only two boys left, Neil and Elliot, a pair of seven year-old identical twins.&nbsp; The game has gone on for hours and the heat swims around us, but they insist on continuing.&nbsp; &ldquo;One more inning,&rdquo; I croak, as the Neil steps to the plate.&nbsp; The wind has stopped, and the world, like the game itself, seems to wait for the next pitch.</p>
<p>&ldquo;What&rsquo;s the score?&rdquo; he asks.</p>
<p>I haven&rsquo;t been keeping score.&nbsp; &ldquo;You guys are winning by one,&rdquo; I lie.&nbsp; &ldquo;Twelve to eleven.&nbsp; Ninth inning.&nbsp; Let&rsquo;s go.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Alone in the field, I still manage to put the boys away quickly in the top of the ninth: a couple of infield flies, a tapper back to the mound, and Elliot is on to close.&nbsp; I wave at a couple of pitches, put a runner on, mask the fact that I&rsquo;m throwing the game.&nbsp; Then, with two down, I hit a grounder toward shortstop and pretend to stumble out of the box.&nbsp; Elliot retrieves and hurls the ball fifteen feet wide of first.&nbsp; Neil gives chase while I run the bases as slowly as possible, but in their panic the boys have lost all sense of accuracy.&nbsp; At the plate I hurl myself in the path of a wild throw, miss, and accidentally land on the plate, winning the game.</p>
<p>The boys, usually reserved, turn on each other, crying unashamedly.&nbsp; &ldquo;Why did you throw that?&rdquo; one demands, but as they tangle I can no longer tell who it is.&nbsp; &ldquo;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you throw it to me?&nbsp; Why did you try to hit him?&rdquo;&nbsp; I stand by, helpless.&nbsp; I am a terrible father figure.&nbsp; I have ruined summer and baseball and America.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Guys,&rdquo; I blurt out, desperately.&nbsp; &ldquo;The game&rsquo;s not over.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;That was the ninth inning,&rdquo; one cries.</p>
<p>&ldquo;But&hellip; this is your school.&nbsp; You go here, right?&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Yeah&hellip;&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;So you must be the home team, right?&nbsp; And the home team always bats last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>The boys pause, sniffling.&nbsp; They think about this.&nbsp; They smile.&nbsp; &ldquo;Yeah. Yeah!&nbsp; Of course it does!&rdquo;</p>
<p>The game resumes, and with a little help, Neil crosses the plate to score the winning run.&nbsp; Elliot rushes in to hug his brother, and they laugh and cheer while I round up the bases.&nbsp; We go back inside to celebrate with ice water.</p>
<p>Later, their mother arrives to take them home for the summer.&nbsp; &ldquo;Mom! Mom!&rdquo; they cry, hugging her legs.&nbsp; &ldquo;We won!&nbsp; We beat Patrick.&rdquo; &nbsp;Baseball and the summer were saved.</p>
