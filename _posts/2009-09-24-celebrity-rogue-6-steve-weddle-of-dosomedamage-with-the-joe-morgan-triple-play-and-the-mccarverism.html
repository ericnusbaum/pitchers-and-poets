  content: Do you also notice how Joe Morgan will attempt to make a point after a
    play and then, when the video replay is consulted and doesn't back up his theory,
    he refuses to correct himself? This happened on a recent telecast when he chose
    a pitcher missing the strike zone to rail on the recent practice of catchers standing
    up when asking for a ball out of the zone. Even as the replay showed that the
    catcher NEVER rose out of his crouch, Morgan continued to argue that the catcher
    standing up on the play had distracted the pitcher by giving him too different
    a look. It galls me. Every single time.

  content: "So true, so true. His strangeness runs so deep, it's no wonder an entire
    genre of obtuse baseball coverage is basically dedicated to his name.\r\n\r\nThanks
    for checking out the Rogue's, Jeff!"

<p><em>Poet, novelist, newspaperman and friend of PnP, Steve Weddle, of <a href="http://dosomedamage.com">DoSomeDamage.com</a>, brings us the latest Celebrity Rogue, in which he investigates the more perplexing side of the logic-miasma that is baseball broadcasting.</em></p>
<h1><a href="http://newcenturypicnic.com/rbi/index.php?title=The_Joe_Morgan_Triple_Play">The Joe Morgan Triple Play</a></h1>
<p><!-- start content -->The Joe Morgan Triple Play is the stating of an idea three times without being interrupted by a single thought.</p>
<p>A good base stealer should make the whole infield jumpy. Whether you steal or not, you're changing the rhythm of the game. If the pitcher is concerned about you, he isn't concentrating enough on the batter.&rdquo; - Joe Morgan</p>
<h1 id="firstHeading"><a href="http://newcenturypicnic.com/rbi/index.php?title=The_McCarverism">The McCarverism</a></h1>
<p><!-- start content -->McCarverism, named in honor of broadcast legend Tim McCarver, is either the most obvious or most oblivious statement that can be made during a game.</p>
<p>Example of the familia obvious in which Tim McCarver explains why the fifth and deciding game of a best of five series has more pressure: &ldquo;No, the fifth game of the first round is the worst, the most pressure, ... That ranks No. 1 because of the difference of the three-out-of-five format and the season. You play 162 games to play three-out-of-five. The disparity between the two is the reason it makes such an impact.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Example of the familia oblivious in which McCarver, well, who knows: &ldquo;If he'd been around 75 years ago, George Gershwin would have written about him 'the way you wear your hat, the way you raise your knee.'&rdquo;</p>
