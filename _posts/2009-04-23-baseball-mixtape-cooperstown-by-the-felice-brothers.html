<p><img class="alignright" src="http://passionweiss.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/01/mixtape.jpg" alt="" width="293" height="187" />Great tune from&nbsp; a band of fiddle and accordion playing/soulish/bobby d and the band-esque rockers who actually grew up near Cooperstown.&nbsp; No cheesy John Fogerty stuff or annoying overdone sound effects of a roaring crowd; just a nice acoustic ballad about baseball. The verses, taken by themselves, are almost like little haikus. Here's a smattering:</p>
<p>Oh Ty Cobb, you&rsquo;re dead and gone.<br />
You had a game like a war machine.<br />
And through the great Hall of Fame, you wandered.</p>
<p>Tigers Field. A girl in heels.<br />
She had a face like a magazine.<br />
And through the long metal stands she wandered.</p>
<p>The ball soars. And the crowd roars.<br />
And the scoreboard sweetly hums.<br />
And tomorrow you&rsquo;ll surely know who&rsquo;s won.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m on first and you&rsquo;re on third.<br />
And the wolves are all between.<br />
And everyone&rsquo;s sure that the game is over.</p>
<p>The catcher&rsquo;s hard, He&rsquo;s mean and hard.<br />
And he nips at the batter&rsquo;s heels.<br />
And everyone&rsquo;s sure that the game is over.</p>

<p>If you dig it, the Felice Brothers' new album, <a href="http://www.allmusic.com/cg/amg.dll?p=amg&amp;sql=10:ajfexzekldse~T1">Yonder Is The Clock</a>, is worth a spin. Especially for the more upbeat tracks.</p>
