  content: I like the intro music, but there's a weird contrast between saying that
    baseball is at once an echo chamber and a place where you meet a wide range of
    people.

  content: I don't think so. There can be a wide range of people inside a single echo
    chamber (there are different types of diversity, I mean). Anyway, we're discussing
    , spitballing, entertaining ideas here. Not necessarily shooting for concise and
    cohesive arguments on the podcast.

  content: Yeah, of course. Also, at the beginning of the season ESPN Mag had an article
    that kind of touched on the same things you guys were pointing out--baseball players
    being really focused on baseball but kind of oblivious to other stuff.

<p>In this episode, we are joined by Paul Franz to discuss the connection between Abbottabad and ex-big leaguer Jim Abbott, baseball and education, homophobic ranting and other fretful major league behavior, the Twitter musings of Will Rhymes, and the drama of repeated foul balls resulting in long at bats.</p>
