<p>I have made a point of avoiding anything that might spoil any part of TAF for me. I *did* buy last month's Vanity Fair so I could read Keith Gessen's article on TAF as a snapshot of the publishing industry (Interesting and infuriating note: when you get to the end of the Keith Gessen article there's a notice that Vanity Fair is selling a longer version of the article in ebook format) but I read the article carefully, skipping over the paragraphs describing the TAF's plot and the ways the book changed over the last 10 years. I remained in the dark, exactly where I wanted to be.<br />
So I was pretty upset when I came across a Facebook comment a little over a week ago about Henry's case of Steve Blass disease. Last week the same diagnosis showed up on this website from other bookclubbers. Had I fallen behind on the reading schedule? Had I skipped the chapter where Schwartz and Pella dragged Henry to the doctor?</p>
<p>If "Steve Blass disease" had been an obscure enough baseball term to show up in the Rogue's Baseball Index, I might have remembered it from my studies. </p>
<p>I can no longer pass. My baseball knowledge is so shallow that I thought Steve Blass disease was a medical condition. It feels good to get that out in the open. (Your turn, Guert.)</p>
<p>Last week I wrote that Henry's collapse wasn't as interesting to me as the anticipation for what comes after the collapse. Then comes a the riveting scene in which Henry calls it quits mid-game. I'll need to retract my previous comment.</p>
<p>I would wrap this up by remarking that Pella's amous bouche of earring is the most compelling example of pica in a baseball novel, but for all I know there was a character in The Natural that ate pencil erasers.</p>
