  content: "Damnit Ted, I was expecting an authentic Hemingway scorecard at that Art
    of Manliness link. Disappointment.\r\n\r\nHemingway: \"You do not have to write
    everything down in your scorebook. The important thing is that you know what happened.
    If you know what happened and aren't being a phony about it, then the reader of
    your scorebook will be able to infer the meaning, the truth, the 4-6-3 double
    play.\" "

  content: "You and me both.\r\n\r\nHemingway's actual shortest story: \"Six, four,
    three.\"\r\n\r\nI'm going to explain the (already suspect) joke and remind readers
    that Papa wrote a famous six word short story:\r\n\r\n\"For sale: baby shoes,
    never worn.\""

  content: I totally got it without the explanation. Actually, Hemingway would have
    hated the damn explanation.

<p>The Art of Manliness offers its own <a title="art of manliness scorekeeping tutorial" href="http://artofmanliness.com/2008/05/29/how-to-score-a-baseball-game-with-pencil-and-paper/">tutorial on scorekeeping</a>. I enjoyed the emphasis on creating your own style, but I would've included more about how to score the way Hemingway did.</p>
<p>Keeping score <a title="rob neyer scorekeeping" href="http://www.sbnation.com/mlb/2011/3/7/2035627/can-great-design-make-scorekeeping-cool-again">makes Rob Neyer happy</a>, and that makes us happy.</p>
<p>At the bottom of this <a title="keith olbermann spring training bryce harper" href="http://keitholbermann.mlblogs.com/archives/2011/03/bryce_harper_i_want_to_kick_th.html">Keith Olbermann post about Bryce Harper and Spring Training</a>, there's a lovely picture of a pin-neat scorecard.</p>
<p><a title="the joy of keeping score by paul dickson" href="http://www.amazon.com/Joy-Keeping-Score-Influenced-Enhanced/dp/0156005166">The Joy of Keeping Score by Paul Dickson</a>.</p>
<p>Roger Angell with <a title="roy halladay roger angell no-hitter" href="http://www.newyorker.com/online/blogs/sportingscene/2010/10/rhythm.html">a sentence on scoring Roy Halladay's historic playoff no-hitter</a>:</p>
<blockquote><p>"Even from a distance, at home again in your squalid living-room loge, you felt something special this time about the flow of pitches, balls and (mostly) strikes, the inexorably approaching twenty-seventh man retired, and, if you happened to be keeping score, the pleasingly staggered, vertically accumulating triads of outs."</p></blockquote>
<p>Bethany Heck, who we interviewed, <a title="notgraphs bethany heck eephus league" href="http://www.fangraphs.com/not/index.php/little-black-book/">wrote a post about her project</a> over at NotGraphs.</p>
<p>MLB has a little <a title="mlb baseball basics scorekeeping" href="http://mlb.mlb.com/mlb/official_info/baseball_basics/keeping_score.jsp">Baseball Basics page</a> on keeping score, and I have to say that the method is a little bizarre.</p>
