  content: Eric, I disagree that he's a pretty ballplayer, but I agree wholly that
    Bradley blows up emotionally the way that a superstar should blow up, without
    ever having been a superstar. He's an Encino ballplayer with a Hollywood heart.

    glibness of the timeline. It's the only thing I ever wrote here just for the traffic.
    (That said, it worked, and Bradley's antics are certainly timeline worthy).

  content: "In 2008, I found myself watching a lot of the Rangers on Extra Innings
    and was fortunate enough to take in a game in Arlington that summer. I really,
    really hoped Bradley stuck around in Texas for much of the reason stated here;
    he seemed pretty content, maybe happy. \r\n\r\nIt's football and God on the same
    level in that area and much like the Mavericks in Mark Cuban's first few seasons
    as owner and those late 90s/early 2000s Stars, the Rangers were sort of anonymous,
    but on their way to develop a significant buzz. They were an emerging, but youthful
    contender (and obviously, we saw them in the Series in the fall) in a place that
    just began to talk about baseball in the summer as much as football. He seemed
    to have fit in well because compared to previous stops in his career, there wasn't
    this uber-crazy spotlight on the Rangers; the fishbowl had Cowboys, Longhorns
    and Aggies crowded the glass while the Rangers lived towards the middle, noticed
    after a deeper gaze.\r\n\r\nSo can I assume that there won't be the long-awaited
    Encino Man 2 with a Bradley cameo?"

  content: "Man, I didn't even consider that. Chicago vs. Texas when it comes to baseball-love.
    Different worlds completely. As somebody who just finished Friday Night Lights
    and knows not what to do with himself in the aftermath, and who was thinking a
    lot about football when writing the piece, I should have considered it. Good call,
    Jason.\r\n\r\nHowever, it's not like Bradley was under the microscope in \"we
    could go to the art museum and then take a walk and then maybe, perhaps, catch
    a ballgame if it's convenient and the sun is shining and Felix is pitching\" Seattle.
    \r\n\r\nI wonder how much the relationship with Wash mattered."

  content: "really great piece. \r\nhowever, i wonder if you underestimate the discrepancies
    between Bradley's construction of himself and how that construction is then received
    by the world around him, by MLB, by fans, and of course and probably especially
    by the media-- both local to DFW, chicago, seattle and nationally. I also think
    this points further to the role race plays in the Bradley persona both as constructed
    by him, but again especially as constructed by the media. You gesture toward this
    in the comment about the bats and I think you're totally in the right direction
    suggesting that Bradley wants to be treated as a human, as a man. Perhaps he hopes
    this treatment can come as a man not as a black man, but inevitably a black man's
    temper tantrum, arrests, comments, etc. in America, in baseball, is different
    from a white man's. I really don't know the Bradley story (or the details of the
    story) much at all, but its clearly rich territory for analysis."

    seen your name around here for a bit.\r\n\r\nI didn't get into race as much as
    I probably should have in this case. That's definitely a strong element -- especially
    considering his comments in Chicago about the Wrigley fans. Seattle is an interesting
    case because it's a suuuuper white city -- but it's also a very progressive one,
    and although it certainly has its problems (especially with the police lately),
    it doesn't have the racially charged history of a Chicago -- or probably a DFW
    for that matter.A\r\n\r\nWorth noting also is that as far as I know, Wash is the
    only black manager MB has played under. Obviously a lot more we should be thinking
    about here."

  content: "I agree there's probably a huge racial element that we could (should?)
    be discussing, but my feeling is that a lot of the racial aspects of how Bradley
    is both perceived and how he wants to be perceived is inherent in simply wanting
    to be treated as a human being first. If that makes any kind of sense, let me
    know.\r\n\r\nThis post captured one of the reasons I love Milton Bradley and the
    types of athletes I'm drawn to. My lens through which I view most of the world
    is through the great books I've read. I absolutely adore characters on edges of
    two things, stuck in transition, and pulled in different directions. Bradley has
    always seemed to be one of those characters, as you've pointed out so eloquently."

  content: "In the spring following the Dodger Stadium water bottle incident, Milton
    Bradley came to the Long Beach middle school where I taught at the time to speak
    to our students. It was clearly an attempt to rebuild his image, but his heart
    was in the right place. He had grown up not from our school, and he wanted to
    give something back to kids who were growing up the way he did: fatherless and
    without the advantages of those on the other side of town.\r\n\r\nBecause my principal
    knew I was the biggest sports fan in the English department, she asked me to coordinate
    the whole thing and supervise the essay contest suggested by Bradley's people.
    When he showed up at the school on the appointed day -- with news crews from four
    local stations -- he spoke about working hard to overcome obstacles, learning
    from mistakes, and listening to parents and teachers. All good, if predictable,
    advice. \r\n\r\nBut he showed his true colors when the four essay contest winners
    and I showed up at Dodger Stadium the next day for the game. We were brought down
    to the field along with a few other groups to watch batting practice. Each group
    was connected to some other Dodger, but none of the other players seemed interested
    in their groups. Milton, on the other hand, came directly over to us in between
    swings in the cage, greeted my students by name, and answered my baseball geek
    questions. (In case you're wondering, even when he's planning on facing a righty
    that day, he still takes a few swings from the right side during BP, just to keep
    things in gear.)\r\n\r\nAfter batting practice, we were paraded out to the first
    base line where we were introduced and flashed on the Diamond Vision in centerfield,
    and then a Dodger photographer came to snap our picture. Here's where things got
    crazy. Milton noticed what was going on and ran over so he could get in the picture.
    Then he saw that the other groups were taking their pictures without a player,
    so he sprinted over to them for their photos. When all the pictures were finished,
    a Dodger PR rep did her best to convince Milton to head back to the clubhouse,
    but he refused. Instead he called back to our group and beckoned us towards the
    dugout. \"Hey, let me introduce you guys to some of my friends... this is Eric
    Gagne.\" (And this is when Gagne was probably the biggest star on the team.) He
    shook all of our hands, <i>and thanked us</i> for coming.\r\n\r\nThere are lots
    of stories about Milton Bradley, but that's the one that I'll always remember."

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2259" title="bradleymail" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/02/bradleymail.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="400" /></p>
<p>When  Milton Bradley was arrested recently at his home for making violent  threats to a woman, I was surprised to learn that he lived in Encino,  CA. Encino is a plain and pleasant section of Los Angeles right at the  mouth of the San Fernando Valley. It's nice --mostly white upper middle  class families-- but it's not Major League nice. It swelters but not  like the deep Valley cities swelter.</p>
<p>I  have a theory about why Milton Bradley lives in Encino, where I  attended a baseball camp and swam in our friends' pool. I think he  craves the quiet. I think to Bradley, Encino represents something of the  idyllic pastoral existence that city people grow up idealizing. The air  in Encino tastes nothing like the salty air of his native Long Beach.  When he walks down the street, the people may recognize him but they  probably don't bother him.</p>
<p>If  I ran into Milton Bradley on the street, I&rsquo;d probably bother him. This  isn&rsquo;t true for most celebrities. But Bradley is different. If individual  players can embody Pitchers &amp; Poets and how Ted and I have come to  consume and understand baseball, he is one of those players. By his  attitude, his place in the ecosystem, his style of play, his perception  in the media, he heightens our understanding of baseball. There are  others like him -- Ichiro, Zito, Berkman, and beyond.</p>
<p>Bradley  switch-hits. That&rsquo;s almost enough in itself. But it&rsquo;s not just that &ndash;  it's how he hits and how he fields and the inexplicable dissonance  between the cool and smooth and patient and effortless Bradley on the  field and the turbulent and vulnerable Bradley off of it. When Bradley  is playing his best baseball, it's as if he's revealing the man he wants  to be &ndash; and by many accounts, usually is &ndash; off the field.</p>
<p>Therein  lies the tension that defines him. Milton Bradley is not a volatile  baseball player; even his signature season with Texas in 2008 was  unassuming. He hit 22 home runs. &nbsp;He got on base. He stayed relatively  healthy. And in the course of that season we saw something different  personally. We saw a contentedness in Bradley&rsquo;s relationship with Ron  Washington. &ldquo;The embrace with Wash was a special one,&rdquo; Bradley wrote in a  guest post for the New York Times baseball blog on making his first  all-star team. &ldquo;It felt like a father-son moment to me. In 30 years,  I&rsquo;ve never really had one of those so I can only imagine that&rsquo;s what it  must feel like.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Vintage  Bradley is patient, collected, and dangerous. His swing is compact in  the legs and the hips, and from both sides of the plate an aesthetic  pleasure. &nbsp;His arms lash across the zone with smooth and level grace. He  gets on base like a professional, never seeming dissatisfied with a  walk. Once upon a time, he was a decent enough outfielder too. &nbsp;But not  even the glimpses of effectiveness reveal Bradley to be a superstar.  Instead they reveal him to be simply above average &ndash; a good ballplayer, a  pleasure to watch, but hardly a superstar, hardly exciting, hardly  excitable.</p>
<p>But of course he is excitable.  He is practically a caricature at times. He loses his temper during  games. He tore his ACL while arguing with an umpire. He broke a bat over  his knee (why is this a magnificent achievement of brutal strength for  Bo Jackson but a pathetic sign of anger and weakness for Milton  Bradley?). I once saw him empty the entire contents of a bag of  baseballs onto the field at Dodger Stadium, then fling ball after ball  into center field in what appeared to be complete obliviousness to his  surroundings. From where I was sitting, I could see whites in his eyes.  They boiled.</p>
<p style="text-align: center;"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://encinovelo.org/winterchallenge/imgs/photos/photo2full.jpg" alt="" width="600" height="390" /></p>
<p>What&rsquo;s  the right way to understand a player who swirls in so many self-imposed  narratives, a player who requires so much? The trait that defines  Milton Bradley, the one trait that sets him apart, even from the other  smart and vulnerable and self-aware players, is that he demands to be  taken seriously as a human being first and a ballplayer second. The  earnest statements, the tearful pledges, the tremor in his voice during  post-game interviews, the on-field incidents, the off-field arrests:  they all reinforce the same subconscious drive to be appreciated or  understood or at the very least accepted. Milton Bradley is a human  being. And he might be a ballplayer and he might be emotional but those  are less important things.</p>
<p>In  this way, Bradley is the anti-ARod. (Some media folks love to posit  Jeter and A-Rod as opposite poles, but really they are the same shiny  clean-faced product designed for mass consumption. Jeter is just better  at being Mickey Mantle.) Bradley is incapable of canned lines. He has no  interest in public relations, in polishing his image. When Charles  Barkley said he didn&rsquo;t want to be a role model, he was rebelling against  the expectations we have for superstar athletes. Bradley is probably  aware of those expectations -- but instead of dismissing them, he is  realigning them: acknowledge me, respect me, then leave me alone.</p>
<p>The  story of Bradley's shortened 2010 season was the simple desire to be accepted  as a regular person with regular feelings and regular problems. This  desire was manifest in his preseason giddiness about sharing a locker  room with Ken Griffey Jr. In the way he tipped his cap to Rajai Davis  after Davis stole away an Opening Day home run. In the way he asked for  mental help, and then came back, and then fucked it all up again. It was  manifest in the way he emotionally confessed to an unsuspecting radio  reporter after homering in an already meaningless May ballgame, &ldquo;I was  full of joy, everything felt right,&rdquo; as if baseball had not felt joyful  or right in a very long time.</p>
<p>Obviously,  things didn&rsquo;t stay right for Bradley in 2010. They haven&rsquo;t begun right  in 2011. The Mariners hired a former nemesis, Eric Wedge, to be their  manager. Fans and local media wondered openly about his future in Seattle. And then there's Encino. The arrest.</p>
<p>Maybe Milton Bradley wasn&rsquo;t ready for the desperate quiet anxiety that  suburban life can elicit, and his arrest and the incidents leading up to  it were the product of that ever-simmering angst and the pressurized  valley air and an offseason spent reading about all the different ways  he was no longer a part of his team&rsquo;s plans. This after the worst year of  his professional career. Or maybe nothing happened at all in Encino.  The charges were dropped. The Mariners had no comment. We&rsquo;ll never know.</p>
<p>All we can know  is that it&rsquo;s a struggle to reconcile Milton Bradley. He is baseball&rsquo;s  Jacob, always wrestling with himself, his managers, his teammates. His  demand -- humanity -- is basic. But his behavior is so erratic, his game  is so unassuming, his very presence is so emotionally wrought, that  &nbsp;unless we step way back, it&rsquo;s easy to not notice that humanity in the  eyes of the public is already Bradley&rsquo;s greatest achievement. Before he  is a baseball player, even before he is a fuck up or a criminal or a  walking injury or a whiner, Milton Bradley is a man.</p>
