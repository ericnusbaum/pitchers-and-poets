<p>Hey readers, as you may have noticed, we've redesigned the site. We hope you like it. Before moving on, Ted & I would like to thank three dear friends for donating their time and creative energy to the cause:</p>
<p><strong><a href="http://lucas-stanford.com">Lucas Stanford</a></p>
<p><a href="http://twitter.com/KolinPope">Kolin Pope</a></p>
<p><a href="http://flipflopflyball.com">Craig Robinson</a></strong></p>
<p>All three were crucial in the process. You'd be smart to support them in all their endeavors. Also, we're not 100% done but close to it -- your feedback is welcome in the comments or at tips@pitchersandpoets.com. Thanks. </p>
