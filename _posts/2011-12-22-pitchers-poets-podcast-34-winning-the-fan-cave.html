<p>In episode 34 of the podcast, we go for a little more structure, including actual quotations from around the web! The Braves attempt to protect their brand, Yu Darvish faces high expectations (from us)and Barry Bonds becomes an expensive scapegoat. Plus, the MLB Fan Cave -- our favorite topic -- has gotten even more discomfiting, but nothing is as discomfiting as the BBWAAA's response to the Bill Conlin scandal. </p>
