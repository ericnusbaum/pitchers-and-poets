  content: "OMG, I thought I'd never see this poem again after I lost track of my
    copy of Fred Schwed, Jr.'s \"How to Watch a Baseball Game\".  Thanks for putting
    this up.  Someone remind me how we lived before the Internet.\r\n\r\nPlease correct
    \"obbligatio\", though.  It's \"obbligato\"."

<p>If you've heard of <a href="http://asteria.fivecolleges.edu/findaids/amherst/ma93_bioghist.html">Rolfe Humphries</a>, it's because of his work as a translator. Many people consider his translatio nthe <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Metamorphoses-Ovid/dp/0253200016">definitive English version</a> of Ovid's Metamorphoses. But this poem is about another kind of mythology - that of baseball and time, Carl Hubbell and Jon McGraw and lesser known players like the poet's father, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/h/humphjo01.shtml">John Humphries</a>. It was first published in the <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/archive/1942/08/22/1942_08_22_022_TNY_CARDS_000190547">New Yorker in 1942</a>, so you know it's good.</p>
<blockquote><p><strong>Polo Grounds</strong></p>
<p>Time is of the essence.  This is a highly skilled</p>
<p>And beautiful mystery.  Three or four seconds only</p>
<p>From the time that Riggs connects till he reaches first,</p>
<p>And in those seconds Jurges goes to his right,</p>
<p>Comes up with the ball, tosses to Witek at second,</p>
<p>For the force on Reese, Witek to Mize at first,</p>
<p>In time for the out&mdash;a double play.</p>
<p>(Red Barber crescendo.  Crowd noises, obbligato;</p>
<p>Scattered staccatos from the peanut boys,</p>
<p>Loud in the lull, as the teams are changing sides) . . .</p>
<p>Hubbell takes the sign, nods, pumps, delivers&mdash;</p>
<p>A foul into the stands.  Dunn takes a new ball out,</p>
<p>Hands it to Danning, who throws it down to Werber;</p>
<p>Werber takes off his glove, rubs the ball briefly,</p>
<p>Tosses it over to Hub, who goes to the rosin bag,</p>
<p>Takes the sign from Danning, pumps, delivers&mdash;</p>
<p>Low, outside, ball three.  Danning goes to the mound,</p>
<p>Says something to Hub, Dunn brushes off the plate,</p>
<p>Adams starts throwing in the Giant bullpen,</p>
<p>Hub takes the sign from Danning, pumps, delivers,</p>
<p>Camilli gets hold of it, a long fly to the outfield,</p>
<p>Ott goes back, back, back, against the wall, gets under it,</p>
<p>Pounds his glove, and takes it for the out.</p>
<p>That's all for the Dodgers. . . .</p>
<p>Time is of the essence. The rhythms break,<br />
More varied and subtle than any kind of dance;<br />
Movement speeds up or lags.  The ball goes out<br />
In sharp and angular drives, or long slow arcs,<br />
Comes in again controlled and under aim;<br />
The players wheel or spurt, race, stoop, slide, halt,<br />
Shift imperceptibly to new positions,<br />
Watching the signs according to the batter,<br />
The score, the inning. Time is of the essence.</p>
<p>Time is of the essence.  Remember Terry?</p>
<p>Remember Stonewall Jackson, Lindstrom, Frisch,</p>
<p>When they were good?  Remember Long George Kelly?</p>
<p>Remember John McGraw and Benny Kauff?<br />
Remember Bridwell, Tenney, Merkle, Youngs,<br />
Chief Meyers, Big Jeff Tesreau, Shufflin' Phil?<br />
Remember Mathewson, Ames, and Donlin,<br />
Buck Ewing, Rusie, Smiling Mickey Welch?<br />
Remember a left-handed catcher named Jack Humphries,<br />
Who sometimes played the outfield, in '83?</p>
<p>Time is of the essence. The shadow moves<br />
From the plate to the box, from the box to second base,<br />
From second to the outfield, to the bleachers.<br />
Time is of the essence. The crowd and players<br />
Are the same age always, but the man in the crowd<br />
Is older every season.  Come on, play ball!</p></blockquote>
