<p>This week's poem is by <a href="http://glennstout.net">Glenn Stout</a>. Stout has been the editor of the <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Best-American-Sports-Writing-2008/dp/0618751181">Best American Sports Writing</a> series since its inception, but he describes himself as "an old poet who found himself writing sports by accident." Stout is also a true believer in both baseball and poetry -- as true as anyone I've ever spoken to. He spent nine consecutive Opening Days parked outside of Fenway Park, reciting poetry through a megaphone and last night we chatted by phone about those poems and other topics. The interview will be up later this week. But for now, read Knuckleball below, and if you like it, <a href="http://www.indiepro.com/glenn/?page_id=21">click this link</a> for some more of Mr. Stout's baseball poetry.</p>
<blockquote><p>I tumble on, barely spinning</p>
<p>each stitch and seam pronounced</p>
<p>afloat and affected by the turbulent air</p>
<p>pushed first this way, then that way</p>
<p>asymmetrical by degrees</p>
<p>going forward from some release</p>
<p>out of hand and out of control</p>
<p>hard to meet squarely</p>
<p>difficult to grasp, easy to drop or let pass</p>
<p>cut loose from one sure grip</p>
<p>to drift and list on homeward</p>
<p>revealing utter confidence</p>
<p>that one still waits, arms out, on knees</p>
<p>a last sharp break to catch and squeeze</p>
<p>between two hands, and then to hold</p>
<p>the pitch at last received.</p></blockquote>
