<ul>
<li><a href="http://walkoffwalk.com">Walkoff Walk</a> has been absolutely killing it lately. Basically go there and read everything.&nbsp; Now!</li>
<li>Dayn Perry reminds us <a href="http://daynperry.com/2010/05/04/the-statistical-absurdities-of-ted-williams/">just how good</a> Ted Williams was.</li>

<li>NY Football Giants Fan Mark Weinstein the Bluenatic has written two great essays in a row:
<ul>
<li>The <a href="http://bluenatic.blogspot.com/2010/04/one-that-got-away.html">heartbreaking story</a> of how he almost edited Josh Wilker's <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Cardboard-Gods-All-American-Through-Baseball/dp/1934734160">Cardboard Gods book</a> (which unfortunately is no longer outselling Sarah Palin's memoir)</li>
<li>An eloquent and poetry-infused(!) <a href="http://bluenatic.blogspot.com/2010/05/my-precious-daughter-ruby-will-be-10.html">reflection </a>on his young daughter and how fandom is inherited/passed on.</li>
</ul>
