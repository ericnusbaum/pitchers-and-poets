<p>I thought of this <a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_you.shtml">Ogden Nash poem</a> yesterday when Walkoff Walk started using <a href="http://www.walkoffwalk.com/2009/04/opening-day-lineupstravaganza-7.html">pictures of dead birds</a> in its Opening Day Lineupstravaganza posts. Anyway, it's a nice bit of optimism for the time of year when only sports writers have determined who the winners and the losers will be:</p>
<p>Wee Willie Keeler<br />
Runs through the town,<br />
All along Charles Street,<br />
In his nightgown.<br />
Belling like a hound dog,<br />
Gathering the pack:<br />
Hey, Wilbert Robinson,<br />
The Orioles are back!<br />
Hey, Hughie Jennings!<br />
Hey, John McGraw!<br />
I got fire in my eye<br />
And tobacco in my jaw!<br />
Hughie, hold my halo.<br />
I'm sick of being a saint:<br />
Got to teach youngsters<br />
To hit 'em where they ain't</p>
