  content: I think this piece has way greater talking points beyond the realm of sports
    and superstition. Even though Mr. Morgan readily admits that, in the eyes of statistical
    analysis, his habits are pointless and silly, he still does something to try and
    tempt fate. Is it really because we are mirroring others or do we, perhaps subconsciously,
    hope there is a greater spirit out there that can affect outcomes? And why do
    we only tend to invoke it for selfish reasons?

  content: "I've been having trouble trying to post this, apologies if it comes through
    more than once but there's a new post so I want to get this up before the topic
    disappears.\r\n\r\nWell Math, I hate to break this to you, but you&rsquo;ll never
    completely extinguish my superstitious flame. <- Very well put.\r\n\r\nTaking
    the discussion points out of order:\r\n\r\nIs baseball the sport where you find
    you&rsquo;re the most superstitious? Yes. It&#039;s also the only one I regularly
    follow on a professional level. Make of that what you will.\r\nWhat are some of
    your favorite superstitious rituals? Not mentioning perfect games or no-hitters
    when they&#039;re in progress. Other than that, I don&#039;t have any favored
    ritual actions per se, but rather feel that consciously paying attention is helpful.\r\nHow
    superstitious are you while following your favorite team? The no-hitter taboo
    applies for any team. As far as rooting goes, it&#039;s less \"superstitious ritual\"
    as much as \"delusions of grandeur\".\r\n\r\nHarry&#039;s questions: I employ
    a complex, multi-level doublethink when dealing with baseball. While I happen
    to be one of those people who do profess belief in a Greater Spirit that can affect
    the world as we know it, I&#039;m generally leery about invoking it for selfish
    reasons/disdainful of those who would do so. The trickier belief to justify is
    that in a not-as-great force that converts psychological states to mundane actions
    in the real world. Try as I might, when it comes down to it, I can&#039;t deny
    that I believe in the latter, /too/.\r\n\r\n...that was unnecessarily philosophical,
    sorry, but if you&#039;re not sick of my ranting by now my opinions are essentially
    summed up by http://humbug.baseballtoaster.com/archives/1085362.html."

  content: "That link to humbug.baseballtoaster isn't working for me. So hopefully
    what I'm about to write isn't stepping on its toes. \r\n\r\nComplete isolation
    while a no-hitter in progress is a superstition(ritual?) I've never completely
    understood. During what inning do other teammates completely stop talking to the
    starting pitcher? What do the un-written rules say? The 5th, 6th, 7th? During
    that 5 or 6 pitcher combined no-hitter magic trick the Astros performed a few
    years ago against the Yanks did each of those pitchers still receive the \"treatment\"
    in the dugout? \r\n\r\nI've noticed that the starting pitcher usually isn't talking
    to many people early in the game anyway, but does the poor guy need a 15 foot
    buffer on the bench later in game if his no-hitter is still intact? I would argue
    that he would perform better if he was still exposed to a normal dugout environment.
    God forbid if someone made a joke about his streak being snapped to loosen him
    up for the next inning!"

  content: "Sorry about that! The link has little to do with no-hitters, so all toes
    are fine. (If you're interested, try removing the period at the end.)\r\n\r\nThe
    unhelpful answer is \"whenever people realize something \"special\" might be going
    on\", probably around the sixth or so. You could make the case that increasingly
    up-to-the-minute coverage (new leads on the MLB home page, etc.) has gradually
    pushed this time earlier.\r\n\r\nAs far as performance being helped by normal
    dugout environments, I would say that the isolation is probably more likely to
    make a pitcher \"snap\" a little. But it could also more likely to keep him sublime--normal
    dugouts produce normal results, abnormal dugouts produce abnormal results? You
    just don't know which one it would be..."

<p><em>Today's Situational Essay comes from Kenneth Morgan, a Mariner fan, and (at least compared to Ted and I) mathematical genius. His essay, in a lot of ways, gets at the essence of Pitchers and Poets. How do we reconcile what we believe to be true and what we know to be true? The superstition and the super-advanced statistical analysis?</em></p>

<blockquote><p><em>&ldquo;When you believe in things that you dont understand<br />
Then you suffer<br />
Superstition aint the way&rdquo;<br />
- Stevie Wonder</em></p></blockquote>
<p>It wasn&rsquo;t this particular verse per se, but rather the smooth transition between my invaluable Stevie Wonder&rsquo;s Greatest Hits CD and the Mariners game. After listening to Dave Niehaus stumble through another half-inning, I started to fuse those last two things I had listened to. I began to realize that I am a much more superstitious fan while following a baseball game than any other sport. What makes baseball so special?</p>
<p>Caps turned inside out, fingers crossed, hands in the praying formation, and watching with one eye closed. Why do we resort to such archaic rituals? I&rsquo;d argue that our behavior can be largely attributed to mirroring the very players we root for on the field. All hitters have some form of superstitious ritual they practice while hitting, with varying degrees of sanity. We recognize some of the usual suspects: Nomar&rsquo;s toe tapping and constant re-adjustments of his uniform, Tony Batista preferring to be parallel to the catcher before the pitcher winds up, and Craig Counsell stretching his bat so high in the air you&rsquo;d think he was trying to touch the moon. These routines are a main reason why we display these same superstitious traits; to help establish familiarity and in turn a level of internal comfort.</p>

<p>During a large percentage of pitches of a ball game, I&rsquo;ve found following baseball to be a very passive and relaxing activity. This isn&rsquo;t to say that I am indifferent to what is transpiring, but rather I find it very difficult to be fully invested in every one of the hundreds of pitches in each game. When more important situations arise I become much more invested, and occasionally will use one of my own superstitious techniques to try and help my boys out. I usually save my empirically sound &ldquo;good luck&rdquo; techniques for high leverage situations. There&rsquo;s no need to waste them on less important at-bats right?</p>
<p>During my earliest years of following the Mariners I adopted a superstitious activity that I&rsquo;ve caught myself practicing occasionally even up until this day. My toe-crossing spawned from what I&rsquo;d imagine was a very tense situation at the end of a Mariners game in the early-mid 90&rsquo;s. At the time of its conception it was as if I truly believed that my toe-crossing would somehow transmit some positive vibes to the M&rsquo;s pitcher or hitter in his time of need.</p>
<p>My background is in Statistics and Math and over the past year I&rsquo;ve tried to really immerse myself in the world of Sabermetrics. The more I have learned about topics like UZR, Dewan&rsquo;s +/-, tRA, wOBA, WPA+, and BABIP fluctuations, the more my superstitious practices have dwindled. Now when I catch myself in the midst of one of my rituals, the condescending voice of &ldquo;Applied Math/Statistics&rdquo; always seems to chime in with some variation of, &ldquo;Even after all we&rsquo;ve learned, this is how you still behave?!&rdquo; Well Math, I hate to break this to you, but you'll never completely extinguish my superstitious flame.</p>

<p>To set the scene: Ichiro is up in the bottom of the 9th, down by five, two outs, with runners on 2nd and 3rd. It would be extremely easy for me to be cynical, detach myself from the moment, and cross my arms while informing those near me what the minute probability of the Mariners winning the game, under these circumstances. But I still enjoy staring the pitcher down and trying to persuade him to throw a hanging curve or a ball in dirt with my robust game-altering psychic powers. Does the great Ichiro even need my help here? Nah. I should probably save my heavy artillery for a crucial Jack Wilson at-bat in the ALCS.</p>
