  content: So far, this is my favorite one you've posted. I feel like the first stanza
    every day. as I read Oakland-Kansas City, or Pittsburgh-Cincinnati box scores.
    Why do I do it. Then love, love, love the ending.

<p>This poem by one Tom Clark descended on me&nbsp; from the heavens,&nbsp; like an omen presented by some ancient Greek god or goddess. Well actually, I saw it on the <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/archive/poem.html?id=176463">sidebar</a> of Tampa outfielder Fernando Perez's <a href="http://www.poetryfoundation.org/journal/article.html?id=237498">recent essay</a> for the Poetry Foundation. Here it is, a simple, pleasant poem for the inquisitive fan in us all:</p>
<blockquote><p>Every day I peruse the box scores for hours<br />
Sometimes I wonder why I do it<br />
Since I am not going to take a test on it<br />
And no one is going to give me money</p>
<p>The pleasure&rsquo;s something like that of codes<br />
Of deciphering an ancient alphabet say<br />
So as brightly to picturize Eurydice<br />
In the Elysian Fields on her perfect day</p>
<p>The day she went 5 for 5 against Vic Raschi</p></blockquote>
