  content: Frank caught my Dad Bob Cerone in the minors with the Yanks. Dad said he
    had an arm like a bullet and instinctively knew how to call a game. If my Dad
    were to judge Feank on how he played way back when, he'd be an MVP. Thank you
    for taking the time to write about a true, "old school" ballplayer, who gave 110%
    whenever he played, and actually ran hard to first base no matter what! Wow what
    a concept!! :)

<p>On May 25, 1972, Frank Fernandez pinch hit for Cubs starter Bill Hands in the sixth inning, grounded out to third base, and returned to the dugout.&nbsp; It was his final at-bat.&nbsp; Because of it, he had unknowingly put himself in the record books.</p>
<p>The at-bat lowered his batting average from .1997 to .1994, thus cementing his career batting average below the Mendoza line.&nbsp; If the ball had snuck through the infield, or hit a pebble in the dirt, he would be forgotten.&nbsp; Instead, he is forgotten, but he holds an interesting title in baseball history.</p>
<p>Frank Fernandez is the greatest player in baseball history to hit below .200 for his career.</p>
<p><a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/06/21/the-man-who-couldnt-hit/ff1/" rel="attachment wp-att-3643"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3643" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ff1.jpg" alt="" width="179" height="250" /></a></p>
<p>In 902 plate appearances over six seasons, Fernandez&rsquo;s career was more valuable (in terms of wins above replacement) than Kenji Johjima, Eddie Taubensee, or Jose Guillen.&nbsp; This despite never having a starting job or a regular role, seeing many of his plate appearances in a pinch-hitting role, and spending his entire career within the second deadball era of the sixties and early seventies.&nbsp; &nbsp;His career walk rate is the seventh best of all time among players with 900 trips to the plate.&nbsp; &ldquo;I&rsquo;d like to hit,&rdquo; Fernandez once complained.&nbsp; &ldquo;But I don&rsquo;t seem to get many pitches to hit.&rdquo;&nbsp; Fernandez obviously had a specific definition of what a good pitch was.</p>
<p>His finest season came in 1969, platooning with Joe Gibbs.&nbsp; In 298 plate appearances, Fernandez hit a career-best .223/.399/.415, with 12 home runs and 65 walks.&nbsp; Appearing in only half the games that year, he was the fourth-most valuable hitter on the team.</p>
<p>Playing for New York, under the weight of its heroes, Fernandez&rsquo;s career was a disappointment.&nbsp; He had dropped out of college at Villanova to play baseball, giving up not only school but his first love, basketball.&nbsp; He was a busted prospect, flashing enough to whet the appetite of the fan without the singles to support it.&nbsp; Once, Fernandez took a bases-loaded walk that scored the winning run of the ballgame.&nbsp; Afterward, reporters asked if he&rsquo;d been afraid to take the payoff pitch, saying that there&rsquo;s nothing more embarrassing than taking a third strike with the bases loaded.&nbsp; It could very well have cost his job.</p>
<p>&ldquo;I was embarrassed all night long,&rdquo; Fernandez replied, having made two errors.&nbsp; &ldquo;How much more embarrassed could I be?&rdquo;</p>
<p><a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/06/21/the-man-who-couldnt-hit/ff2/" rel="attachment wp-att-3649"><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3649" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ff2.jpg" alt="" width="350" height="248" /></a></p>
<p>Fernandez is remembered today by a single anecdote.&nbsp; When one is a .1994 hitter, one&rsquo;s life is fraught with missed opportunities.&nbsp; For Frank Fernandez, such a life came to a head on August 27, 1970.&nbsp; Late in the game Fernandez hit a shot off Mike Cuellar down the third base line toward Brooks Robinson.&nbsp; Usually, this would be fitting.&nbsp; Instead, this time the ball was hit so sharply that Robinson had no time to react. &nbsp;The ball hit his shin and ricocheted directly into the hands of shortstop Mark Belanger, who had ample time to make the throw to first.&nbsp; He didn&rsquo;t.&nbsp; The throw sailed wide and Fernandez wound up at second base.&nbsp; Over the intercom, Baltimore&rsquo;s official scorer ruled the play an error.</p>
<p>For a man who spent his life desperate for base hits, this insult was enough.&nbsp; Fernandez was caught in the middle of a philosophical argument: do we judge a man by what he does, or what happens to him?&nbsp; When the ball left his bat, based on its force and trajectory, it was a base hit.&nbsp; By the time it reached first, independent of his actions, it had become an error.&nbsp; Ultimately, Fernandez had no control over his fate.&nbsp; Upon scoring on a Campaneris single, he took the only thing he had, his batting helmet, and flung it at the heavens in protest.&nbsp; As tends to be the case in these moments, the act was ultimately futile.&nbsp; He was ejected, fined $250, and ridiculed.</p>
<p>&ldquo;All Fernandez is making all the fuss about,&rdquo; said Harry Caray in the booth, &ldquo;is whether he hits .200 or .198 this season.&rdquo;&nbsp; In fact, it meant hitting .199 or .200 in his career. In the end, it&rsquo;s a strange and arbitrary demarcation, and yet, like Mendoza, it came to define him. &nbsp;But to diminish &ldquo;all he was making a fuss about&rdquo; is to take a man out of context, to separate his actions so as to filter the life from him.&nbsp; We can&rsquo;t judge that play without understanding eleven years of bad hops and diving catches that came before.&nbsp; Baseball is a game of constant failure, where even the best of players succeed only 40% of the time.&nbsp; For Fernandez, a backup on the World&rsquo;s Greatest Baseball Team during one of its least great eras, the weight of that disappointment is all the more crushing.&nbsp; At some point, it is enough.</p>
