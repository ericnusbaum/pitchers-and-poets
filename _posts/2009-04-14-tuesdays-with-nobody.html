  content: It has to do with the sanctity of Opening Day as an event.  Having a day
    off after a home opener gives the opportunity to push things back a day for weather
    reasons, and that is a big deal with all of the special events and ticket holders.  Why
    they would bother doing that in LA or other non cold weather cities, though, is
    quite odd.

<p>Last week, the Indians and Rangers opened a series on a Monday, took Tuesday off, and resumed Wednesday.</p>
<p>This week, the Dodgers and Giants are doing the same thing. So are the Mets and Padres.</p>
<p>Can somebody please explain this? Am I way late in noticing the pattern/complaining about it? Seriously. Existentially threatening questions like this are why I blog.</p>
<p><em>Update:</em></p>

<p>That makes sense --Opening Day ticketholders don't want to miss out on the festivities in case of bad weather in badweather locations. But it doesn't tell me why the Padres would have a <a href="http://sandiego.padres.mlb.com/schedule/index.jsp?c_id=sd">game scheduled the day after their home opener</a>, but not the Dodgers. Then again, it's pretty clear that I'm no expert on the schedule making process.&nbsp; There are a lot of numbers to align and it's obviously an imperfect process by nature; maybe this is just a little blemish they thought they could hide behind the curtain of tradition.</p>
<p>Also goes to show that on matters of rain delays, people who grew up in Southern California are not to be trusted.</p>
