<p><a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/category/1990s-first-baseman-week/"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/90s1b1.png" alt="" width="600" height="107" /></a>Dear Baseball Fans:</p>
<p>These have been an epic two weeks. 1990s First Basemen Week started as a loose concept album, a free associative invitation to ramble. It is a testament to the magnetism of Mssrs McGwire, Vaughn, Bagwell, Olerud, Thomas, and the rest that, despite our very broad concept, so many contributors and readers immediately found themselves on the very same page. We all knew what it meant to talk about first basemen from the 1990s. We all felt it.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3488" title="tommy the who" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/tommy-the-who-300x300.png" alt="" width="300" height="300" />As far as we are concerned here at P&amp;P HQ, the concept album went platinum. You laughed, you cried, you offered to write about the mediocre slugger that everyone else had long forgotten about. The week expanded from one to two, the album grew to a double disc.</p>
<p>It's been a privilege to curate the joy and the sorrow, the amazement and the dread that these fellows channelled. But even more, it's been a joy to curate such a remarkable group of writers. The first basemen of the 1990s may not be dead, but you still somehow managed to bring them back to life.</p>
<p><strong>For that, we offer a huge THANK YOU to every one of our contributors.</strong> This was <em>your</em> week(s). You contributed to the monumental chronicling of an era, not through stats or lists, but through stories. Also, particular thanks go to the talented Kolin Pope--<a title="kolin pope twitter" href="https://twitter.com/#!/kolinpope">@kolinpope</a> who is also the force behind our new design--for the epically appealing and amazingly appropriate header image, which has really tied the room together.</p>
<p>Sincerely,</p>
<p>Ted and Eric<br />
