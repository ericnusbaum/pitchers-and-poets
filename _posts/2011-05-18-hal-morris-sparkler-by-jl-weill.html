  content: A sweltering July day in 1982 Ohio and I am attending a Columbus Clippers
    game, AAA team for the Yankees. The first baseman is a huge man with the size
    and grace of a backwater wrestler. He comes to the plate in the bottom of the
    first with a man on, two outs. The bat looks like a billy club in his hands. He
    crushes a ball out of the stadium into the parking lot. Steve "Bye Bye" Balboni.
    He was later called up and won a world series ring with KC where he set single
    season team records of 36 HRs and 166 strikeout. I'll never forget him.

<p>It certainly shows my age, but when I think of a first baseman, I don&rsquo;t usually think of your hulking muscle-bound jock with a goatee and thorny tattoos encircling his Thor arms. Instead, I think instead a skinny spray hitter with a funny-looking batting stance who you&rsquo;d be unsurprised also had an MBA. He probably wears glasses off the field, and likely he does his own taxes. He definitely doesn&rsquo;t drive in many runs, but you love him because what he does he does really well. Yes, I think of Hal Morris.</p>
<p>Growing up like I did in central Kentucky, nearly every kid I knew was either a Reds fan or, because of TBS, a Braves fan. I loathed the Braves mostly because every swirlie-giving jackass at my school was a Braves fan and I just never really much cared for the cut of Dale Murphy&rsquo;s jib. While the Braves were being touted fictitiously as &ldquo;America&rsquo;s Team,&rdquo; the Reds were decidedly un-sexy. Seemingly every year of my mid-teens, they kept finishing in second place with Pete Rose Bettor- Managing and Marge Schott puffing away on cheap smokes while draining the team of scouting funds. But there was something likable about the guys who finished second despite everything. They were a group that had talent but always played hard and overachieved, a reflection of Rose&rsquo;s best qualities.</p>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-3371" title="hal morris leaf" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/hal-morris-leaf.png" alt="" width="233" height="336" />In the winter of 1989, the Reds made what seemed a pretty innocuous throwaway trade over the offseason, acquiring a promising 17-win minor league pitcher named Rodney Imes and a utility infielder-outfielder with no power named Hal Morris for a garbage starter and change. Well, as those trades tend to work out more often than you&rsquo;d think, the centerpiece for the Reds never made it to the big leagues, but Morris, after logging a middling 38 at-bats in two seasons with the Yankees, came aboard a team that &ndash; while no one really knew it yet &ndash; was about to tear it up and blossomed.</p>
<p>Morris was the definition of a role player. Platooning with fellow cog Todd Benzinger, the light hitting lefty Morris posted a .340 average in his rookie year, but only 36 RBIs. Still, on a team that was built on pitching, defense, flexibility and, more than anything, a killer bullpen, having a guy who got on base, didn&rsquo;t strike out and didn&rsquo;t boot grounders was more than adequate. Oh, and Morris even took a few games in the outfield to boot.</p>
<p>That Morris was also a quiet sort, workmanlike and consistent, only added to his value, both to his team and to Cincinnati&rsquo;s principally blue collar and middle class fanbase. And as a Reds fan, at least the Reds got something of value from the Yankees, considering in two years they&rsquo;d be trading a future Yankees legend for the inimitable Roberto &ldquo;Call me Bobby&rdquo; Kelly.</p>
<p>Personally, I prefer to live in the halcyon days of the batter&rsquo;s box-dancing Morris. It may not make you think of fireworks, but sometimes a good 50 cent sparkler gets the job done just fine.</p>
