<li>Mark Twain's love of baseball, documented in "A Connecticut Yankee in King Arthur's Court," was the subject of a <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/2010/03/14/sports/baseball/14twain.html"><em>New York Times </em>profile</a>. He once lost an umbrella at a professional game and placed the following ad in his local paper:</li>
</ul>
<blockquote><p>FIVE DOLLARS REWARD</p>
<p>At the great base ball match on Tuesday, while I was engaged in hurrahing, a small boy walked off with an English-made brown silk UMBRELLA belonging to me, and forgot to bring it back. I will pay $5 for the return of that umbrella in good condition to my home on Farmington avenue. I do not want the boy (in an active state) but will pay two hundred dollars for his remains. SAMUEL L. CLEMENS</p></blockquote>

<li>Speaking of iconic artists, Walkoff Walk <a href="http://www.walkoffwalk.com/2010/03/whitey-ford-and-salvador-dali.html">shares an old&nbsp; commercial </a>featuring Whitey Ford and Salvador Dali.</li>

<li>Jake Peavy brought together's baseball's best musicians for Woodjock, and David Brown from Big League Stew was <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/blog/big_league_stew/post/Desert-Drive-Peace-ballplayers-and-music-at-Pe;_ylt=AiMzFOeFDk._Bw_9o5SEiv4RvLYF?urn=mlb,227667">there to witness it</a>.</li>
