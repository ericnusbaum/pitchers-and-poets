<p>In Podcast 6, Ted and I discuss Jackie Robinson day in critical (not critical as in negative, but in critical as in we are doing criticism) terms. We also contemplate the obligations of broadcasters as they call no-hitters, the nature of Chicago White Sox fans, and the pace of play between the Yankees and Red Sox. Plus, cameo appearances from Frank Deford, Mark Mulder, and Mel Gibson.</p>
<p>Put on your No. 42 jerseys, America, and turn up the volume:</p>
