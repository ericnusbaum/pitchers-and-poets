  content: Man on Wire was a really cool movie, definitely watch it. As far as a six
    walk no-hitter it is impressive sure, but I just can't bring myself to get that
    excited by it.

  content: "I've always thought it would be confusing to be witness an opposing pitcher
    no-hitting the hometown club.  Sure, if it's a blowout, the odds of victory would
    be so low that it would make no sense to root for your offense.  But what if it's
    a close game?  I'm not sure how I would feel.  \r\n\r\nOn a related note, if you
    want to see a no-hitter in person, I recommend Mariners season tickets.  King
    Felix or Cliff Lee both have the stuff and they have a top-tier defense behind
    them.  The M's are also coming off a season in which they had, easily, the worst
    offense in the league.  They then took that offense and subtracted arguably their
    two best power hitters.  So yes - I think it will happen at Safeco this year."

    a no-hitter:\r\n1. Kerry Wood's 20-K one-hitter (May 6, 1998 if you want to look
    it up)\r\n2. Harvey Haddix's loss in the 13th after being perfect through 12 innings
    (since he did give up a hit in the 13th, it doesn't count as a no-hitter, but
    it SHOULD, dammit.)"

  content: I'd like to see an absolute no-hitter going into the bottom of the 9th,
    2 outs (that is, both pitchers throwing no-hitters). And let's end it with a first-pitch,
    walk-off homerun just to leave everyone completely confounded.

  content: "Man on Wire was a great movie, yeah.\r\n\r\nI think no-hitters are defined
    by their mystique and not level of excellence as per Eric. Probably each individual
    one falls somewhere different on the Scale of Excellent Pitching Performances;
    Jimenez' is towards the lower end of the Excellent part of the scale, Haddix's
    near the top of the charts, etc. But we appreciate them for being something else.\r\n\r\nI,
    personally, have a hard time understanding and appreciating the physical actions
    of baseball in the park or on TV, so I'd much rather see a no-hitter live for
    the cool factor. I've seen a perfect game turn into a no-hitter and then into
    a mere shutout, all in the ninth inning. I also saw Kelly Shoppach tie the record
    for extra-base hits in a game.\r\n\r\nHarry: yes. The ending made me chuckle.
    Good call."

  content: "Speaking of the Expos and no-hitters and witnessing history, I've seen
    a perfect game in person (Dennis Martinez). Despite the fact that it was nearly
    20 years ago and that my team was on the losing end, I still remember it being
    pretty magical. By the ninth inning I was able to put my usual rooting interest
    aside and start rooting for El Presidente. And seeing him sitting in the dugout
    afterward with tears of joy running down his face made it even more special.\r\n\r\nAs
    great as that memory is, I'd still trade it for being able to see my Dodgers win
    a World Series in person."

    hear what you've seen and what you want to see. \r\n\r\nThe 20 strikeout game
    is, I agree, a far superior feat to a six-walk no-hitter. There's a lot of luck
    in the game of hitting hits, after all. Far less so in the game of striking hitters
    out."

  content: Been enjoying the great stuff on this site after we brought our own meditative
    madness into cyberspace with a collaborative blog of imaginary baseball glory
    not so long ago. Several of us are Denver natives and Rockies fans who never dreamed
    one of our dude's could throw a no-hitter. That is, until Ubaldo turned in one
    helluva gutsy performance. It's the PROCESS that should be marveled at; I've posted
    a revised transcription of the radio broadcast you all might wanna check out,
    in order to fully appreciate just how this particular no-hitter came to be.  Keep
    up the good work, boys.

  content: Great editing on the transcript. Nice to see how his pitch count evolved,
    and where that whole stretch thing came from. I believe Don Larsen had success
    from the stretch at one point and decided just to start from the stretch during
    the perfect game.

    out the game without allowing a hit definitely get better the fewer batters you
    have left to go.\r\n\r\nBaseball!"

    its a nice accomplishment, but really. 6 walks? That seems a bit of a letdown.

  content: "It's true that most pitches and pitchers look the same from the stands,
    but witnessing something great, or even just interesting, with a crowd makes the
    experience better.  It's like as seeing a great band live. Even if you don't get
    up and dance and don't feel the need to push your way up to the very edge of the
    stage  - you'd think the only real difference between live music and recorded
    music is the volume, but there's also an energy in a crowd that is infectious.
    \ Same goes for a no hitter (I assume).  \r\n\r\nI tend not to think about what
    I'd really like to see though.  I like every baseball experience I have to be
    new and unexpected.  Maybe someday I'll see a no hitter and if I do it will be
    all the more exciting for my not having hoped for it in advance.\r\n\r\nSpeaking
    of baseball, and pitchers, and things that are worth seeing, and to prove once
    again that I have a Sports Night quote for every occasion:\r\n\r\n\"There's really
    nothing like seeing a guy realize he's not done yet\" - Dan (Sports Night - The
    Sword of Orion)"

<p><strong>Ted:</strong> Eric, Ubaldo Jimenez<a href="http://www.insidetherockies.com/2010/04/17/jimenez-throws-first-no-hitter-in-rockies-history/"> threw the first  no-hitter of the year</a>, which creates a great opportunity to discuss one  of the more distinct accomplishments that baseball has to offer. I can't  think of another accomplishment in sport that receives so much  attention for preventing something from happening. No shutout by any  goalie, dominant number of blocks from a basketball big man or NFL  defensive wall has quite the cultural cachet as the no-no does.</p>
<p>I  still get all tingly when a pitcher throws a no-hitter. What is it  about the feat, and the watching of the feat, that is so dramatic and  compelling?</p>
<p><strong>Eric: </strong>I have always admired the  basketball Triple Double because it comes with a sense of completeness  -- it highlights balance and teamwork and efficiency. But rebounds are  far less romantic than strikeouts. The great thing about the no-hitter  is that it's a high-wire act. With every succeeding batter the odds of  it actually happening get slimmer. The other thing is that like a  high-wire act, a no-hitter allows for a certain amount of wobbliness.</p>
<p>Ubaldo  Jimenez walked a precarious six batters when he threw his no-no. That's  far from a perfect game. The perfect game is a different feat, a  symmetrical achievement that borders on the artistically genius (I wrote  about it <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2009/07/24/the-catch/">here</a>). A no-hitter like the one thrown by Jimenez is as much  about guile, as much about nerves, as much about fear, as it is about  pitching.</p>
<p>When pitchers throw perfect games, they look  invincible. But when they throw no-hitters, they look human. That's why I  won't let go of my high-wire metaphor. Have you seen <a href="http://www.manonwire.com/">Man on Wire</a> by the  way? I've been meaning to check it out on Netflix Instant.</p>
<p><strong>Ted:</strong> I  have seen Man on Wire. You will love it for the same reasons you'll  love the 1978 Expos: if you're into the 70s and eccentric French people.</p>
<p>I  don't know if I'm buying your starry eyed vision of a 6-walk no-hitter.  When I heard that little side note about the free passes I felt the  feat was that something of a gold-plated clunker, to get the credit for a  no-no when you've let six men on base. After all, the point of a  no-hitter is that you dominated the opposition, not that you gave up an  inordinate number of free outs. There's a point at which it becomes a  gimmick, like saying a guy just threw a no-doubler or a no-balker.</p>
<p>Now  obviously I'm exaggerating; it was still a dominant performance. But  can we put this into the canon of great performances? I suppose it  doesn't matter: it's really fun to watch a pitcher walk the tight rope.</p>
<p>Have  you ever seen a no-hitter in person? I haven't, and I wonder what it's  like. Thoughts?</p>
<p><strong>Eric:</strong> This is the point in our  conversation when I inevitably tip my cap to the blogosphere's ghost of  the Expos, Jonah Keri. Moving on, I don't know if I buy your sudden  sabermetrically induced skepticism. It's a no-hitter, not a no-walker.  Have there been 1-hitters or 3-hitters pitched better than Ubaldo's  no-hitter? Probably. But they aren't magic.</p>
<p>In other words, I  don't think the idea is that you dominated. The idea is that you didn't  allow any hits. NO HITS! I don't see it as a gimmick at all. The  no-hitter is not about retrospect. It's not about analysis. It's about  the moment. Some accomplishments grow greater in scope as we look back  on them. No-hitters are at their most dynamic as they are occurring.</p>
<p>I  haven't seen a no-hitter in person. But this is why I've always wanted  to. I don't think there's any sporting achievment I'd rather see in  person. I saw Fernando Tatis take Chan Ho Park for two grand slams in  the same inning. I saw Ichiro break the single season hit record. But  I'd trade both to see a no-hitter in person. I can only imagine the  shivers and the tension and the elation at the end of it all.</p>
<p>What  about you? If you could see any baseball achievement in person, what  would it be? I know you're a fan of the cycle's mystique.</p>
<p style="text-align: left;"><a href="http://bradleysanimalplace.files.wordpress.com"><img class="aligncenter" src="http://bradleysanimalplace.files.wordpress.com/2008/07/champ.jpg" alt="" width="500" height="375" /></a></p>
<p><strong>Ted:</strong> I  feel fortunate to have actually seen the achievement I most wanted to <a id="r267" title="in person" href="http://alamosweet.wordpress.com/2009/06/08/a-little-custom-baseball-card-fun/">in person</a>: Craig Biggio's 3,000th hit.  As you've very effectively pointed out, that one was about retrospect,  not about the tension of the moment. If you're talking single-game  variety achievements, I'd most want to see <a id="c5x_" title="Josh Wilker" href="http://cardboardgods.net/">Josh  Wilker</a> throw out the first pitch at a <a id="jhlp" title="Vermont  Lake Monsters" href="http://vermont.lakemonsters.milb.com/">Vermont Lake Monsters</a> game.</p>
<p>Some cynical part  of me thinks that a no-hitter is best appreciated from home, via  television. That's where the mastery is clear, after all. From the  stands, most pitchers look the same, as do most pitches. The results  would be engaging, obviously, but the true depth of the accomplishment  goes out the door. I'm not saying I wouldn't want to be there, just that  the experience is profoundly different. It's very likely that I am  over-thinking it. I'd love to see a no-hitter in person.</p>
<p>Having  no-hit myself with 18 walks, logic-wise, we'll just have to agree to  agree. No-hitters are as awesome as eccentric French people and the 70s.</p>
