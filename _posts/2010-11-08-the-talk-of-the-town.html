<p>Some brief notes of congratulations:</p>
<p>1. Friend of P&P (and occasional contributor) Reeves Wiedeman has published his first article, a Talk of the Town piece in <em>The New Yorker:</em> <a href="http://www.newyorker.com/talk/2010/11/08/101108ta_talk_wiedeman">Far From Haiti.</a></p>
<p>2. Another friend,  Josh Cohen, has launched an online interview project meant to capture the joy and spirit of another sport (also a far more effective method for commuting than baseball is) cycling: <a href="http://thebicyclestory.com">The Bicycle Story. </a></p>
<p>3. Yet another friend, Drew Fairservice of the recently redesigned Blue Jays blog <a href="http://www.ghostrunneronfirst.com/">Ghostrunner on First</a> has joined up with Rob Neyer as part of the Sweet Spot Network. Obviously well-deserved. Congrats. </p>
