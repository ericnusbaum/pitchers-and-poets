<p><em>Dan&nbsp;McQuade&nbsp;writes and plays Rock Paper Scissors in Philadelphia. He has an&nbsp;<a href="http://philadelphiawilldo.com/" target="_blank">infrequently-updated blog</a> and a&nbsp;<a href="http://twitter.com/dhm" target="_blank">frequently-updated Twitter</a>.</em></p>
<p>John Kruk doesn't like being taunted about having one testicle.</p>
<p>Who knows what he thinks, really. Don't presume a man is going to tell the truth in a <em>Philadelphia</em> magazine interview where one of the previous questions was, "Did she think Mitch brought his homeless buddy along for a meal?"<sup>1</sup> But, in that 2007 interview, Kruk said a guy at a high school football game in West Virginia made a testicle joke once.</p>
<p>"He yelled it from far away, I&rsquo;ll tell you that, because I woulda beat the shit out of him," Kruk told Phillymag. "If people I know joke, like Mitch Williams, it&rsquo;s a joke. People I don&rsquo;t know, they deserve their ass beat."</p>
<p>I guess I knew a whole lot of people in 1994 who deserved to have their asses beat. I was an 11-year-old in Northeast Philadelphia, and Kruk was a running gag in the playgrounds and schoolyards across the Far Northeast. A lot of people simply knew Kruk, who <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=vOYyAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=tQcGAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6975%2C2115215">had surgery</a> to remove his cancerous right testicle that March, as the baseball player with one ball.</p>
<p>Kruk's lasting career highlight was a comical right-handed at-bat against Randy Johnson in the 1993 All-Star Game, but he was actually a pretty good player over his 10 seasons (.300/.397/.446 slash line; 133 OPS+). He went to three All-Star Games and hit .348 in the '93 World Series.</p>

<p>And, of course, he did it while being fat.</p>
<p>John Kruk the baseball player, as opposed to John Kruk the running gag for 11-year-olds, is the fat guy who played baseball. He wasn't enormous, but he was usually overweight and unkempt looking. He's "the poster boy for critics who deride baseball players as [not] physically fit athletes" (Murray Chass, <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1995/07/31/sports/baseball-different-departures-for-bagwell-and-kruk.html"><em>The New York Times</em></a>, 1995)<sup>2</sup>. He "doesn't look good, partly because of a diet that features hot dogs and hamburgers" (Robert Fachet, <em><a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/washingtonpost/access/74031332.html?dids=74031332:74031332&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Jun+10%2C+1992&amp;author=Robert+Fachet&amp;pub=The+Washington+Post+(pre-1997+Fulltext)&amp;desc=Phillies'+Kruk+Gorges+Himself+on+Diet+of+Base+Hits&amp;pqatl=google">Washington Post</a></em>, 1992). He "looked like a classic Chicago softball player." (Mike Royko, <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=JTBKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=94UMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=1151%2C3104970"><em>Chicago Tribune</em></a>, 1993). The adoration continues today: "John Kruk was Kenny Powers before Kenny Powers was Kenny Powers." (Drew Magary, <a href="http://www.nbcphiladelphia.com/blogs/philthy-stuff/My-Favorite-Phillie-Legends-Edition-John-Kruk-120956764.html">NBC Philadelphia</a>, 2011).</p>
<p>The classic Kruk story is his response to a fan who questioned his conditioning: "I ain't an athlete, lady, I'm a baseball player." His autobiography's even called <em>I Ain't an Athlete, Lady</em>. To be fair, the woman's alarm only came after she saw Kruk drinking beer and smoking cigarettes at a restaurant during spring training.</p>
<p>Kruk didn't care about his weight -- "Besides, two years ago, I was skinny and had the worst year of my life," he said -- or indeed what people seemed to think of him at all. Naturally, he <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2011-04-27/sports/29478677_1_morning-bytes-tommy-greene-jimmy-rollins">didn't always</a> get along with reporters. Kruk's attitude and physique gained him a bit of a following as a baseball everyman, the smartass kid from West Virginia who made it big.  He <a href="http://pqasb.pqarchiver.com/baltsun/access/113564658.html?dids=113564658:113564658&amp;FMT=ABS&amp;FMTS=ABS:FT&amp;type=current&amp;date=Apr+19%2C+1992&amp;author=Rich+Hofmann&amp;pub=The+Sun&amp;desc=For+Phils'+free-swinging+Kruk%2C+there's+no+science+to+heavy+hitting&amp;pqatl=google">changed his stance</a> all the time. He had a mullet.<sup>3</sup> In the <em>Tribune</em> Royko called him his new sports hero and "the best thing to come along since Yogi Berra." <em>The Virginian-Pilot'</em>s Larry Maddry <a href="http://nl.newsbank.com/nl-search/we/Archives?p_product=VP&amp;p_theme=vp&amp;p_action=search&amp;p_maxdocs=200&amp;p_topdoc=1&amp;p_text_direct-0=0EAFF6C2E8E1375C&amp;p_field_direct-0=document_id&amp;p_perpage=10&amp;p_sort=YMD_date:D&amp;s_trackval=GooglePM">became a fan</a> after Kruk came to the plate in the 1993 NLCS with a giant rip in his pants. Philadelphia went crazy for him that year, as the Phillies lost to the Blue Jays in six. There were John Kruk lookalike contests!<sup>4</sup></p>

<p>Today, we think of John Kruk as a boring ESPN analyst, one of the <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Baseball_Tonight_personalities">mostly interchangeable</a> 25 people  on <em>Baseball Tonight</em>. He said the Yankees would <a href="http://www.firejoemorgan.com/2006/04/john-kruk-prediction-corner-train.html">win 130 games</a>, by far <a href="http://www.firejoemorgan.com/2006/03/john-kruk-prediction-corner-2006.html">his most insane prediction</a>. A lot of people really loathe him. Seriously. <a href="http://search.twitter.com/search?q=john+kruk">Search Twitter</a>.</p>
<p>But let's be clear: John Kruk is awesome. He <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=aNcgAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=DGsFAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2743%2C5222906">retired</a> in the middle of a game after getting one last hit. He <a href="http://wvgazette.com/News/hidden/200808040471">feared for his life</a> after a roommate who robbed banks believed it was Kruk who turned him into the FBI.  He <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=8ihKAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=zYUMAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=5340%2C3573743">zoned out</a> after catching a fly ball in left and allowed Bobby Bonilla to score from second.<sup>5</sup> Chris Farley <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Xy3NzykDSao&amp;feature=player_detailpage#t=82s">played him</a> on <em>Saturday Night Live</em>.</p>
<p>And he beat cancer. He returned from <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=WCdSAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=wjUNAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=2395%2C3805754">radiation therapy</a> for the home opener and <a href="http://news.google.com/newspapers?id=IoQwAAAAIBAJ&amp;sjid=iuwDAAAAIBAJ&amp;pg=6818%2C5835927">got three hits</a>. John Kruk was <em>Lance Armstrong</em> before Lance Armstrong was Lance Armstrong.</p>
<p>---</p>
<p><sup>1</sup> I have been told this story by several people: When the movie <em>Rookie of the Year</em> came out, John Kruk was asked how he'd feel were a 12-year-old to strike him out. His response: "Get the hell away from me!"</p>
<p><sup>2</sup> The <em>Times <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/15/sports/world-series-high-grade-phillies-defy-low-expectations.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm"></a></em><a href="http://www.nytimes.com/1993/10/15/sports/world-series-high-grade-phillies-defy-low-expectations.html?pagewanted=all&amp;src=pm">also described</a> Kruk as "the Phillies' Huck Finn in residence." Presumably, he tricked Darren Daulton into whitewashing a fence.</p>
<p><sup>3</sup> "On this Twitter thing," <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2011-05-02/sports/29495763_1_standing-room-only-tickets-phils-dave-hollins/2">Kruk tells</a> the <em>Philadelphia Inquirer</em>'s John Gonzalez, "at least five people a day say 'bring back the mullet.'"</em></p>
<p><sup>4</sup> Steve Odabashian, the lawyer who sometimes <a href="http://pwblogger.com/articles/15723/cover-story">dresses up</a> as Andy Reid, is <a href="http://www.steveodabashian2011.com/">running</a> for City Council. I don't think you need me to tell you that both the <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2011-04-27/news/29478664_1_gop-candidates-frank-rizzo-jr-city-council-candidates"><em>Inquirer</em></a> and the <a href="http://articles.philly.com/2011-05-05/news/29513006_1_city-council-questions-council-members-candidates"><em>Daily News</em></a> endorsed him.</p>
<p><sup>5</sup> The batter, R.J. Reynolds, <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/boxes/PHI/PHI198906070.shtml">was credited</a> with a sac fly.</p>
