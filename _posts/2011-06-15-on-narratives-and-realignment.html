<p><em>Editor's Note: We are pleased to bring you Patrick Dubuque's first post as this summer's Bill Spaceman Lee Visiting Professor for Baseball Exploration. Please enjoy:</em></p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;The broken flower drooped over Ben&rsquo;s fist and his eyes were empty and blue and serene again as cornice and fa&ccedil;ade flowed smoothly once more from left to right, post and tree, window and doorway and signboard each in its ordered place.&rdquo;</p>
<p>-William Faulkner, <em>The Sound and the Fury</em></p></blockquote>
<p>The words &ldquo;The End&rdquo; don&rsquo;t appear in Faulkner&rsquo;s masterpiece, because the story doesn&rsquo;t end; it just stops.&nbsp; In the postmodern literary arena, the traditional story arc has fallen out of favor, replaced by an unflinching, gritty examination of life as is.&nbsp; Climaxes and conclusions are left for the situational comedy, the summer blockbuster and the Dan Brown spiritual thriller.&nbsp; Instead, we get the repeating signboards, and the vantage toward the horizon, with the misery of human existence as it disappears and resurfaces ad infinitum.</p>
<p>Baseball is in no way postmodern.&nbsp; This week, however, a few of its storytellers are modeling with the hypothetical, toying with the concept of realignment. &nbsp;Authors and readers alike strain to envision a world in which the Mariners play the Padres in late September, as opposed to July, or a future where Carlos Lee is a designated hitter rather than a designated hitter who happens to take the field every inning.&nbsp; The whole conversation is wonderful off-season banter, oddly timed in its arrival in early June.&nbsp; <a href="http://mlb.sbnation.com/2011/6/12/2219728/mlb-realignment-bring-it-on">Rob Neyer</a> and <a href="http://mlb.sbnation.com/2011/6/12/2220163/mlb-realignment-not-so-fast">Al Yellon</a> over at SB Nation present their cases for and against admirably.&nbsp; My response is to reprint the well-worn cartoon that made the baseball blog rounds several weeks ago:</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-3585" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/06/15/on-narratives-and-realignment/sports_medium/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3585" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/sports_medium-225x300.png" alt="" width="225" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>The important part of the comic (for my purposes) is not the seeming randomness from which the narrative is derived: <em>The Return of the Native</em> is a story essentially extracted from the meteorological effects on British topography, breaded with crumbs of angst.&nbsp; Instead, what&rsquo;s worth discussing is the creation of those narratives, a goal that the sport certainly aims to accomplish.&nbsp; Essentially, baseball is driven by two very separate forces: the desire to have the greatest team crowned as champions, and the desire to have an interesting, dramatic month of playoff baseball.</p>
<p>As fans, we&rsquo;ve&nbsp;inured&nbsp;ourselves to the fact that the current division and playoff formats are an uneasy alliance between excitement and realism.&nbsp; Unlike the other major sports (except perhaps basketball), the qualities that reflect a good regular season baseball team do not necessarily lend themselves to the playoffs, where fourth starters are nearly useless and losing four out of seven games is entirely reasonable for a team that lost a third of them up to that point.&nbsp; Any plan to expand the playoffs simply introduces more luck into the formula for deciding champions, and reduces the importance of the regular season.</p>
<p>What this phenomenon lacks in purity, however, it makes up for in narrative.&nbsp; A realignment that introduces more teams also provides more underdogs, more parity, and more seventh games. &nbsp;It's democracy, in all the best and worst senses of the word. &nbsp;It provides the hope for victory by diluting that victory, forgetting that too many memorable moments make each of them equally unmemorable.</p>
<p><a rel="attachment wp-att-3590" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/06/15/on-narratives-and-realignment/large_cubs/"><img class="aligncenter size-medium wp-image-3590" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/large_cubs-209x300.jpg" alt="" width="209" height="300" /></a></p>
<p>So we have a hypothetical system designed to add excitement to every season, but people aren&rsquo;t fans of seasons; they&rsquo;re fans of teams.&nbsp; A team&rsquo;s narrative isn&rsquo;t meant to be a trifling, six-month one-act play.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s a Michenerian epic, spanning years and generations.&nbsp; Success should come from hard work and skill, the culmination of sweat and suffering and disaster.&nbsp; So too should tragedy. &nbsp;It needs its fatal flaw, its catharsis.&nbsp; To have these results come at the hands of a fluke, a mindless twist of fate, is to render the whole exercise arbitrary, and reduce the work back into a string of random numbers.</p>
<p>Benjy, one of the few Faulkner characters to escape a novel with contentment intact, does so by keeping his gaze on the horizon. &nbsp;In baseball, this is the meaningless weekday afternoon game in August, the second division teams playing for pride. &nbsp;It's baseball for its own sake, just as the existentialists gave up on winning and championed life for the sake of life.</p>
