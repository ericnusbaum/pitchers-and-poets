<p><a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_abom.shtml">This poem</a>, by super-poet/children's writer/scholar/translator/holder of cool initials&nbsp; <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/X._J._Kennedy">XJ Kennedy</a> is not, in fact, about<a href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/players/profile?playerId=3382"> Brian Giles and his .443 OPS.</a> But it is about vampires, so Brian Giles does have something to do with it.</p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">I swung and swung at empty air<br />
And when I heard the umpire<br />
Behind me shout, "Strike three - you're out!"<br />
My bat turned to a vampire.</span></p>
<p align="left"><span style="font-family: Arial; color: #000000;">The whole team had to pry it loose.<br />
Poor Ump looked sorta flat.<br />
Now ever since, my bat and I<br />
Walk every time we bat.</span></p>
