<p>Now is the time of year when we all take a moment to acknowledge how quickly time slips away, and how the events of January, 2o11, don't seem like they happened <em>a whole year ago. </em>I'm glad to have done this, though, as I've had to the chance to re-examine our efforts on the year, and to appreciate just how much we've accomplished here. There are so many great voices represented, and a cabinet of baseball wonders available any time. <em><br />
</em></p>
<p>So some months did fly by, but we did some great things this year, and we don't mind checking back in on the mad dashes and the meditative moments. We hope, of course, that you enjoyed the ride as much as we did, and we look forward to future flights of fancy with you, our fantastic readers and fellow passengers on Steamship Baseball.</p>
<h2><a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/category/scorekeeping-week/"><strong>Scorekeeping Week</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/03/scorekeeping-week_title-banner1.png" alt="" width="600" height="257" />Our first foray into themed weeks, Scorekeeping Week was a fine jaunt through the habits of fans and professionals as they log a baseball game's events.</p>
<p>I <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/03/09/you-gotta-keep-score-mariners-broadcaster-dave-sims-talks-scorekeeping/">interviewed Mariners broadcaster Dave Sims</a>, about his scorekeeping habits, and we learned more about <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/03/07/bethany-heck-interview/">Bethany Heck and her brilliant scorekeeping books</a>. <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/03/12/runs-runes-ruins/">Paul Franz</a>,<a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/03/10/alex-belth-late-bloomer/"> Alex Belth</a>, <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/03/08/2449/">Patrick Truby</a>, and <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/03/11/the-poetics-of-scorekeeping/">Patrick Dubuque</a> offered their stories and memories.</p>
<p>Scorekeeping Week was a quiet, pleasurable affair, and it stoked our interest in themed content. See below for the Frankenstein's monster that resulted.</p>
<h2><a title="1990s first basemen week" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/category/1990s-first-baseman-week/"><strong>1990s First Basemen Week</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/90s1b1.png" alt="" width="600" height="107" />Looking back at P&amp;P2011, we would be crazy not to give full due to the year's biggest, insanest phenomenon on the blog. Eric and I started with a simple idea: let's talk about first basemen from the 1990s, and let's get as many great writers involved as we can.</p>
<p>We released a salvo of emails, and the only directive was to pick a first baseman and talk about him. The breadth of responses and creative output was amazing, and the response overwhelming.</p>
<p>It all started with a <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/05/09/short-hop-jonah-keri/">Short Hop on Jeff Bagwell and Frank Thomas</a> from Jonah Keri, and <a title="jt snow" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/05/09/jt-snow-the-platonic-ideal-on-defense-by-eric-freeman/">an essay on J.T. Snow</a> by Eric Freeman. Readers started to understand what we were doing, and the purity of our goal. The nostalgia started to flow, and the content barreled onward, with work from Will Leitch <a title="pedro guerrero" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/05/09/short-hops-pedro-guerrero-by-will-leitch/">on Pedro Guerrero</a>, longtime reader playwright Larry Herold <a title="rafael palmeiro, will clark" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/05/10/perfect-rangers-texas-first-basemen-passing-in-the-night-by-larry-herold/">on Rafael Palmeiro and Will Clark</a>, and Jesse Thorn <a title="mark grace jesse thorn" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/05/10/short-hops-mark-grace-by-jesse-thorn/">on the grace of Mark Grace</a>.</p>
<p>The 1990s first baseman embodied something beautiful and sad and nostalgic for us and for our readers. The big men stirred the poetic inside us. Tom Ley<a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/05/10/the-big-cat-and-the-water-by-tom-ley/"> remembered an encounter with Andres Galarraga</a>, and Joe Posnanski remembered <a title="joe posnanski jeff king" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/05/11/reluctant-king-by-joe-posnanski/">a quixotic slugger in Jeff King</a>. Josh Wilker<a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/05/12/carlos-quintana-by-josh-wilker/"> thought about Carlos Quintana</a>, I went on for some length <a title="jeff bagwell sadaharu oh ted walker" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/05/11/one-or-eight-jeff-bagwell-sadaharu-oh-and-the-mystery-of-the-batting-stance/">about Jeff Bagwell and Sadaharu Oh and batting stances</a>, Eric <a title="eric karros, eric nusbaum" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/05/20/the-things-we-shared/">thought on Eric Karros</a>, and how could we forget Dylan Little's <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/05/13/an-imagined-interview-with-hal-morris-by-dylan-little/">imagined interview with Hal Morris</a>.</p>
<p>And, of course, Pete Beatty cleared the bases with his <a title="jim thome ruin porn pete beatty" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/05/18/jim-thome-takes-his-rips-by-pete-beatty/">meditation on Jim Thome and ruin porn</a>.</p>
<p>There are so many more contributors who made this such a great couple of weeks for us at the blog, and the best thing that you can do is click the headline above and read every last one of them. For us, 1990s First Basemen Week was just awesome.</p>
<h2><a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/category/reading-club/"><strong>P&amp;P Reading Club: <em>The Art of Fielding</em> by Chad Harbach</strong></a></h2>
<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4155" title="the art of fielding by chad harbach" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/the-art-of-fielding-by-chad-harbach.png" alt="he art of fielding by chad harbach" width="204" height="319" />In late September, we started the <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/category/reading-club/">P&amp;P Reading Club</a> by collectively reading and opining about the above-mentioned best-seller about baseball, life, and the convergence. Hey, just like our little web site here! It was great fun, and again we featured lots of great writers (can you sense a theme in our approach to content development?). Chapters flew by with our posts tagging closely at heel, and we all had a fine time basking in the literature of it all.</p>
<p>Click the header above to find all of those fine posts. Contributors included Carson Cistulli, Adam Webb, Megan Wells, Patrick Dubuque, Pete Beatty, Navin Vaswani, Dayne Perry, Bryan Harvey, Eric, and myself.</p>
<h2><strong>The Milton Bradley Saga, Continued</strong></h2>
<p>Eric has become something of an expert on the culture of Milton Bradley, and his <a title="milton bradley" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/02/16/encino-man/">essay on the troubled outfielder, <em>Encino Man</em></a>, early in the year, affirmed the honorary. "If individual players can embody Pitchers &amp; Poets and how Ted and I have come to consume and understand baseball, he is one of those players. By his attitude, his place in the ecosystem, his style of play, his perception in the media, he heightens our understanding of baseball." He <a href="pitchersandpoets.com/2011/04/13/milton-bradley-revisited/">revisited the player in April, 2011</a>, around the time Milton started to wear earplugs.</p>
<h2>Month-to-Month</h2>
<p>In <em>February</em>, <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/02/21/a-new-look/">we redesigned the site</a>. We still love it.</p>
<p>In those doldrum days, we also got news of <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/02/22/the-words-get-out-miguel-cabrera-and-the-life-of-language/">Miguel Cabrera's feisty run-ins with the law</a>, and Eric's <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/02/24/we-are-baseball-a-manifesto/">Manifesto called for making nostalgia modern</a>. And hey, do you remember when Albert Pujols still seemed like he'd re-sign with the Cardinals? The <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/02/18/the-measured-meter-of-money-the-st-louis-cardinals-and-the-pujols-gambit/">measured meter of money</a> spelled bad news for Cardinal fans.</p>
<p><em>Opening Day</em> meant a live chat, as Eric and I watched 37 games in a row and all at once, while my wife made ballpark franks. It was <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/03/31/pp-all-day-mlb-opening-day-live-chat-2011/">a marathon</a>.</p>
<p><em>April</em> brought Eric's realization that <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/04/21/the-angel-of-life/">ownership issues were afoot in Dodgerland</a>, and I <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/04/22/cliff-lee-and-the-myth-of-the-moment/">contemplated the newly settled Cliff Lee</a>. Other topics included <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/04/27/lightning-round-otis-nixons-hair/">Otis Nixon's hair</a>, the <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/04/18/situational-essay-the-language-of-degree-and-kind-in-baseball-and-life-by-paul-franz/">language of Coors Field</a>, and the burgeoning<a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/04/29/sam-fuld-learning-the-legend/"> Legend of Sam Fuld</a>. I also <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/04/07/the-texas-rangers-are-fearless-and-friendly/">discussed the odd couple Rangers</a>, who did well to carry through with the promise I noted.</p>
<p><em>May</em>, see 1990s First Basemen Week.</p>
<p><em>June</em> saw us bring <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/author/patrick/">Patrick Dubuque</a> into the fold of regular contributors. He immediately started <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/06/15/on-narratives-and-realignment/">bringing </a><a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/06/28/the-final-game-of-the-season/">the </a><a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/07/06/the-problem-of-the-pick-off-throw/">thunder</a>, as we knew he would. Jesse Gloyd took us<a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/06/23/a-river-slums-through-it-by-jesse-gloyd/"> fishing in the shadow of Chavez Ravine</a>, I opened the <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/06/27/the-joba-file-private-anxiety-made-public-in-baseball%E2%80%99s-age-of-potential/">Joba File</a> and learned to<a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/06/16/finding-jered-angertainment-and-the-reluctant-appreciation-of-an-ace/"> appreciate Jered Weaver</a>, and Eric Freeman explored <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/06/08/bryce-harper-and-the-elements-of-style-by-eric-freeman/">the style of Bryce Harper</a>. Eric <a title="clay huntington" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/06/06/nothing-is-frivolous/">remembered Northwest icon Clay Huntington</a>, too, and caught us up on<a title="matt kemp" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/06/10/style-sin-and-matt-kemp/"> the power and the glory of Matt Kemp</a>.</p>
<p><em>July</em> was a quieter time, though Aaron Shinsano checked in to provide <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/07/18/presidents-and-unicorns-a-scout%E2%80%99s-take-on-the-president%E2%80%99s-cup-in-korea-by-aaran-shinsano/">a scout's view of the President's Cup in Korea</a>.</p>
<p>In <em>August</em>, Eric <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/08/29/why-couldnt-i-buy-a-dodger-hat-at-dodger-stadium/">couldn't get a Dodgers cap at Dodger Stadium</a>, I <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/08/25/the-best-show-the-best-game-and-the-boundaries-of-every-creative-universe/">explored the Best Show on WFM</a>U, Simon Broder <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/08/04/situational-essay-of-broken-bats-and-broken-bottles-athletes-musicians-and-the-number-27-by-simon-broder/">viewed the cursed celeb and Amy Winehouse through the baseball lens</a>, Pete Beatty did some<a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/08/26/its-not-lov/"> girl-storytelling</a>, and Jesse Gloyd brought us <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/08/11/too-many-xs-by-jesse-gloyd/">thoughts on Satchel Paige</a>.</p>
<p><em>September</em> and <em>October</em> passed like a hard fall wind as we dipped our heads in literature (see <em>Art of Fielding</em> above), and <em>November</em> brought some pensive missives from Aaron Shinsano with more <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/11/07/situational-essay-zen-and-the-art-of-scouting-by-aaron-shinsano/">tales from scouting in Asia</a>, Patrick on<a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/11/17/injury-as-metaphor/"> injury as metaphor</a>, Brian K on <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/11/02/situational-essay-a-cardinals-fan-reflects-on-the-end-of-the-la-russa-era/">new life without LaRussa</a>, and some chat from me on the <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2011/11/22/uniforms-in-retrograde/">retro trend in new uniforms</a>.</p>
<p>Which brings us to <em>December</em>. Eric and I have been hitting the podcast hard, polishing it up and filling it with quirky, enjoyable content so that we can hit the new year in fine stride. Podcasting is the perfect complement to the site, we think, because, really, we're into conversations first and foremost.</p>
<p>2011 at Pitchers &amp; Poets was a year of backs and forths, of multitudinous viewpoints, of unending conversations, multi-leveled stories and sing-alongs.</p>
<p>Here's to a happy new year, and a fruitful and thoughtful 2012.</p>
