  content: Wow. If I ever have a product that needs selling, I'm doing everything
    I can to get Vin Scully as my pitchman. And now I'm going to do everything I can
    to find some Farmer John bacon.

<p style="text-align: left;">Jon Weisman of <a href="http://dodgerthoughts.com">Dodger Thoughts</a> is listening to old ballgames. Here's Vin Scully in 1980 with a tour de force on America's zeitgeistiest meat:</p>
<blockquote><p>So what's new? Not bacon. Bacon is almost as ancient as time itself.  It was mentioned by Aesop in the sixth century B.C. It was a staple in  medieval Europe. And in Norman England, bacon was so universally  accepted, it was sometimes used as money. And monastery monks awarded  bacon to husbands for not quarreling with their wives. Indeed, bacon is  no Johnny-come-lately. Through the years, it has survived the  competition of thousands of new products, and the bacon bin continues to  be a popular spot in our modern supermarkets. One reason is the quick  energy it survives, and another its matchless flavor. Which brings up  the most flavorsome bacon of all: Farmer John. For this is a bacon with a  sweet, savory goodness from hush-hush secrets in the curing, plus a  much heartier Western flavor from Farmer John's old-time Western way of  doing the smoking. No other bacon like it &mdash; if you haven't tried it, why  delay any longer? The next time you shop, take home the bacon from  Farmer John.</p></blockquote>
