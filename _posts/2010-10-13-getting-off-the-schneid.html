    identifies as being Jewish

<p>One of my day jobs involves blogging for a Jewish themed website called Jew-ish.com. In that capacity, I wrote a post today inspired by Roger Angell about <a href="http://jew-ish.com/index.php?/blogs/blog1_item/3736">Getting off the Schneid</a>.</p>
<p>The crux:</p>
<blockquote><p>The Rangers&rsquo; victory, Angell wrote, &ldquo;took them off the schneid.&rdquo; I&rsquo;ve  never understood this phrase. I like it. As a child, I liked hearing  (Jewish) sportscaster Chris Berman draw it out like schneeeeiiiid on  ESPN. And soon, I figured out its meaning by context. But I never knew  where it came from. To a non-sports fan, to somebody who did not as a  child watch hours upon hours SportsCenter, what the hell could a schneid  possibly be? And how would one get off a schneid?</p>
<p>The term, it turns out, like many of our great expressions, has  Yiddish roots. It came to baseball by way of gin rummy, a card game once  popular amongst my grandparents.&nbsp; In Yiddish a &ldquo;schneider&rdquo; is a tailor.  And in gin rummy slang, to be eliminated from a game is to  &ldquo;schneidered&rdquo;&mdash;as in cut out from contention, the way a tailor cuts  cloth.</p>
<p>Hence &ldquo;the schneid&rdquo; in baseball as a losing or winless streak. No  word on which early 20th century sportswriter or p.r. man first used the  term in the baseball sense, but our crack research staff is on it.</p></blockquote>
