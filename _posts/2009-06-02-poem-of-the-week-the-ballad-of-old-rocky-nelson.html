<p>A (somewhat&nbsp;sarcastic, I think) &nbsp;<a href="http://www.baseball-almanac.com/poetry/po_rcky.shtml">poem</a> by Canadian <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Raymond_Souster">Raymond Souster </a>about light-hitting&nbsp;outfielder <a href="http://www.baseball-reference.com/players/n/nelsoro01.shtml?redir">Rocky Nelson</a>:</p>
<p>When old Rocky Nelson shuffles up to the plate<br />
The outfield shifts round and the fans all wait.</p>
<p>He takes up his stance which ignores every law,<br />
Has a last slow suck of the quid of his jaw,</p>
<p>And waits while the pitcher makes up his mind<br />
What new deception his arm can unwind.</p>
<p>Then the ball comes in and the sound of wood<br />
That's heard by the ear does the loyal heart good,</p>
<p>And the ball rises up like a hunted thing<br />
Pursued by an angry bumble-bee's sting,</p>
<p>And the outfielders run but it's no use at all-<br />
Another one over the right field wall.</p>
<p>And as Rocky trots slowly around the bases<br />
Happiness lights up twelve thousand faces.</p>
