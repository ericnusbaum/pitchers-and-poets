<p><em>Pitchers and Poets <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2010/11/02/situational-essay-the-last-harrah-the-last-senator-the-first-ranger-the-eternal-man/">contributor</a> Ben Lyon, a lawyer in Chicago, pipes up this week with a look back in time, to several of the great debates that have shaped the course of history.</em></p>
<p>These are heady times for the sports military industrial complex&mdash;the ground is littered&nbsp;with forgotten college basketball teams, the opening filibusters over who will get the #8&nbsp;seeds in the NBA and NHL playoffs are slowly emerging, and best of all, labor strife&nbsp;in the NFL and the NBA is propelling the insurgent LaCrosse, Wisconsin Assessor&nbsp;candidacy of Mike Golic. Faux-outrage is at its zenith in early March.</p>
<p>But what of the pointless sports debates of previous generations? In our rush to find the&nbsp;next menial debate to fill the final 90 seconds of <em>Around the Horn</em> we fail as citizens if&nbsp;we don&rsquo;t recognize when a seemingly endless debate is finally settled. Will America ever&nbsp;agree that Bobby Jackson deserved to be NBA Sixth Man of the Year in 2002-2003?</p>
<p>Doubtful, as too much blood has been spilled, and the wound on our body politic remains&nbsp;too fresh.</p>
<p>And of course who amongst us can forget the fateful summer of &lsquo;92: Young Cleveland&nbsp;Indian second baseman Carlos Baerga has been selected to the All-Star team as a last-minute injury replacement. The upstart Baerga is selected over avuncular Detroit&nbsp;Tiger first baseman Cecil Fielder. Despair commences in certain quarters, with ESPN&nbsp;Analyst Peter Gammons channeling his best John C. Calhoun impersonation when he&nbsp;says, &ldquo;Baseball is trying to attract fans! And a lot more people would prefer to watch&nbsp;Fielder than Baerga!!&rdquo;</p>
<p>(If emoticons had been invented at this point, Gammons would have used the&nbsp;following: &ldquo; :< &rdquo;)</p>
<p>So who did deserve to be in this All-Star game? Thankfully, the Baseball Writers&nbsp;Association of America is here to serve as our philosopher-king and settle this issue.&nbsp;At first glance, it appears that Gammons was wrong. Baerga (pinch hitting for Roberto&nbsp;Alomar Jr.) went 1-1 in the game; using Moneyball Sabermetics, we can calculate that&nbsp;at this pace, Baerga would have gotten a hit every time for an average of 1.000! Fielder&nbsp;did finish 9th to Baerga&rsquo;s 11th in the 1992 MVP vote; however, they both finished behind&nbsp;Mike Devereaux, thus invalidating this as an argument.</p>
<p>Fast-forward to this winter, when the wise heads at BBWAA finally ended all debate.&nbsp;Carlos Baerga&mdash;he of 3 All-Star games, a league leading 444 Assists in 1995, and six&nbsp;triples in 1993 (good for 9th in the AL)&mdash;received 0 Hall of Fame votes. In 2004, Cecil&nbsp;Fielder received 1 Hall of Fame vote. By this indisputable math, the career of Fielder is&nbsp;infinity times better than that of Baerga. It therefore goes without saying that a player&nbsp;who is infinity times better than another deserves to make it into the 1992 All-Star game&nbsp;as an injury replacement.</p>
<p>In 1992, a grave injustice was committed. In the winter of 2011, this injustice was&nbsp;definitively rebuked--well for all except Jay Bell who hit only .264 in 1992 but somehow&nbsp;got 2 HOF votes!</p>
