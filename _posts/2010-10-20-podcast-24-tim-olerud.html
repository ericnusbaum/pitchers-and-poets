  content: "My sister was a member of the Pat Burrell fan club for a while, after
    seeing \"the Philippines\" [sic] as PHI on an out of town scoreboard.\r\n\r\nThe
    baseball science fiction market is, perhaps surprisingly, extant; just in the
    time travel subgenre there's the (Player name) and Me series by Dan Gutman, \"Noonan\",
    \"Tartabull's Throw\"...mostly for younger readers, maybe, but there are some.
    That doesn't mean I wouldn't love to collaborate on a blog-produced one.\r\n\r\nI
    also think there's a difference between enjoying a book and finding it good enough
    to give a prize to. Not that there necessarily /should/ be but the distinction
    exists."
