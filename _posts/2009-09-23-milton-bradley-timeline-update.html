Here is the recently added update to the world famous <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2009/06/30/the-definitive-unsourced-milton-bradley-timeline/">Definitive Unsourced Milton Bradley Timeline</a>.</em></p>
<p><strong>2009 B: </strong>Hitting .257 in September, Milton Bradley is suspended from the Cubs for the duration of the season after blaming Cubs <em>fans</em> for the team&rsquo;s failure to win a World Series (you would suspect a GM would be thankful for that sort of comment). The suspension leaves Bradley and the Cubs in a sort of purgatory, as it is clear the team does not want him back and he does not want to be back in Chicago. How will this glorious soap opera end? Fear not. Evidently a graduate of the Nothing is Fucked school, or completely unaware that the goddamn plane has crashed into the mountain, Hendry reassures Cubs fans: <em>We don&rsquo;t anticipate any problems. We&rsquo;ll have it all worked out in the next few days. </em></p>
