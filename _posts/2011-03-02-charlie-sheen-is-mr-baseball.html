<p>For all of the madness that Charlie Sheen has injected into the pop culture conversation of late, there&rsquo;s a side note, a low harmonic hum just beneath the blaring orchestra of drugs and sex, that bears noting here: <em>the man loves baseball</em>.</p>
<p><strong>Evidence:</strong></p>
<ul>
<li>Sheen invited current and retired ballplayers (some speculate that he&rsquo;s <a title="imitating brian wilson charlie sheen" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.nbcbayarea.com%2Fnews%2Fweird%2FCharlie-Sheens-Hallucination-He-Is-Brian-Wilson-117094008.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGMiJjroHSEl_1XckDMbcPPsFdGoQ">imitating Brian Wilson</a> this whole time, which, if it were sanctioned would prove to be near-Franco level pop culture foiling) to his house to watch the movie that he made about baseball. That movie, <a title="major league charlie sheen film" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.imdb.com%2Ftitle%2Ftt0097815%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNE8_Qt13hVJrvmt_t40ui5LNRi1dQ">Major League</a>, is one of the best baseball movies ever, due, in no small part, to Sheen&rsquo;s performance. He referred to himself and his buddies Wilson and Lenny Dykstra as &ldquo;gnarly gnarlsons.&rdquo; Of the visit,<a title="brian wilson charlie sheen quote" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Fmlb%2Fblog%2Fbig_league_stew%2Fpost%2FBrian-Wilson-s-Charlie-Sheen-visit-isn-t-a-contr%3Furn%3Dmlb-324718&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNFHLKUVKyr8u0qtmsBEU51-CsHJ9g"> Wilson said</a>,  &ldquo;When Rick Vaughn calls the bullpen I'm going to answer &mdash; on a professional level, of course.&rdquo;</li>
<li>He&rsquo;s ready to make the <a title="next Major League film project" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.hollywoodreporter.com%2Fnews%2Fcharlie-sheen-wants-a-new-159798&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGvOsN6-jO1Fe0lTgm5kd5wzAYQbw">next Major League movie</a>.</li>
<li>A story came out <a title="richard justice charlie sheen story houston" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.chron.com%2Fsportsjustice%2Farchives%2F2011%2F03%2Fas_a_matter_of.html&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEdX8iq1mnHFs3h8X3Z9dOQV69D9Q">from Houston&rsquo;s Richard Justice</a> that Sheen had a go-to guy to set up a full-on baseball game every time he came to town. A full game! This not like rounding up the usual suspects for a pick-up game of basketball; this is occupying a college baseball field with full sets of nine or more.</li>
<li>He wears what he purports to be a <a title="charlie sheen babe ruth world series ring" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fblogs.thescore.com%2Fmlb%2F2011%2F03%2F02%2Ffamous-junkie-likes-baseball-spending-money%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNH5xC1Gq6Bjr4q9ednMp1ydxR_oFQ">Babe Ruth World Series ring</a>.</li>
<li>Of the few people he follows on Twitter, two of them are baseball stars (Nick Swisher and Brian Wilson). In the pictures he links to via Twitter, he wears an Indians cap.</li>
<li>He <a title="charlie sheen ucla baseball pep talk" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fsports.yahoo.com%2Fmlb%2Fblog%2Fbig_league_stew%2Fpost%2FCharlie-Sheen-gives-memorable-pep-talk-to-UCLA-s%3Furn%3Dmlb-320135&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNGdem8xGI8tcTkZwzfl26MebTr0dw">gave a pep talk</a> to the UCLA baseball team, in which he inspired the team with the following message: &ldquo;Don&rsquo;t do crack, drink chocolate milk, and enjoy every moment. That&rsquo;s all I got.&rdquo; He wore a Cincinnati Reds hat for the raspy appearance.</li>
<li>Of course, Eric let us know about <a title="charlie sheen batting practice" href="http://www.google.com/url?q=http%3A%2F%2Fpitchersandpoets.com%2F2011%2F03%2F02%2Fcharlie-sheen-hits-homeruns%2F&amp;sa=D&amp;sntz=1&amp;usg=AFQjCNEX4tFvF_T_pigk66RGl3-dbWFhsA">Sheen&rsquo;s trips to the ballpark</a> to take batting practice and oh, by the way, <em>mash</em>. Must be the tiger blood pulsing through his veins. Or the chocolate milk.</li>
</ul>
<p>Is Sheen the ambassador that baseball is looking for? Probably not, but his love of the game seems to be some kind of a space anchor for him as he hurtles through the Milky Way.</p>
