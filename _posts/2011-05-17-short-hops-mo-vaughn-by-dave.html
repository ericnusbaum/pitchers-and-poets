<p><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-3315" title="mo vaughn swing" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/05/mo-vaughn-swing-300x256.png" alt="" width="300" height="256" />I submit Maurice Vaughn. Not just because he was the first baseman for the decade in Boston, but because he's practically an &ldquo;I Love the 90s&rdquo; walking metaphor. His body encapsulates the 90&rsquo;s first baseman (lumbering). Being called "The Hit Dog" would only happen in the 90s. And he got one of those crazy-for-the-time historical contracts and promptly fell in a dugout his first game, never to be the same in the following decade.</p>
