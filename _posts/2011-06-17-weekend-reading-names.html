  content: "I am not a big fan of DVR sports...speaking of when I used to have cable
    + DVR...speaking mostly of watching soccer matches, usually EPL or Champions League,
    plus MLS and international stuff.\r\n\r\nI just did not have the patience to always
    stick with the match from start to finish.  The emotion of the game -- the angst
    and anticipation of near-misses, the rhythm of passing and movement, the feeling
    of release after a goal is scored -- was stunted.  And as CK alludes to, it drove
    me nuts to know that I could simply hop online and know exactly when the goals
    were coming.  There is no point in watching a match if you know when the goals
    are coming, but sometimes I could not resist going online anyway.\r\n\r\nAs silly
    as it sounds for a fan watching an Arsenal match in the attic of a home in Columbus,
    OH, one of the joys I experience when cheering a goal is feeling a part of the
    community of fans around the world.  Same type of feeling when cheering a goal
    for Team USA such as Donovan's World Cup match winner.  I just don't get that
    feeling watching it on DVR five hours later.    \r\n\r\nPerhaps the virtue of
    DVR sports varies on the sport in question?"

  content: "BTW Teddy, loved the Weaver column.  Wish the Angels were getting more
    return on their club-record payroll!  Feels like a snakebitten club at the moment,
    between the promising young pitcher Adenhart killed by the drunk driver and the
    slugging first basemen Kendry(s) Morales suffering a basically 2-year injury absence
    for over-celebrating a walk-off homer.\r\n\r\nDoesn't help when the high profile,
    pricey acquisitions of late have been Vernon Wells and Scott Kazmir.  Back when
    I followed baseball more closely than I currently do, those two dudes were studs.
    \ \r\n\r\nFeel free to dissect more Angels in the future!  Planning to see the
    club when they visit Detroit in late July.  You know we're in Ann Arbor now, yes?"

CK is easily my favorite contributor to the quite remarkable Grantland stable. Here, he explores what is, for me, a regular part of baseball writing: the DVR.
