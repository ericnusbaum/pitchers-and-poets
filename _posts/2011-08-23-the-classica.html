<p>Meanwhile, on other parts of the internet, there is a group of writers trying to raise money for a new sports website. I'm honored to be a part of that group, and as such here is the intro video for The Classical:</p>
<p><iframe src="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/101341727/the-classical/widget/video.html" frameborder="0" width="480px" height="410px"></iframe></p>
<p>We're not talking about a blog here, we're talking about an in-depth publication featuring high quality, fact-checked, heavily reported essays. We're talking about smart, funny, intellectually considered content published every day. Not just by the people mentioned in the video, but by writes you love and writers you will love.</p>
<p>Also: we're giving out cool prizes, ranging from chip clips to our personal sports memorabilia to the folks who donate.</p>
<p>For more info, or if you care to contribute, <a href="http://www.kickstarter.com/projects/101341727/the-classical">CLICK HERE</a>.</p>
<p>And obviously, tell your friends. And also obviously, if you have any questions, fire away.</p>
