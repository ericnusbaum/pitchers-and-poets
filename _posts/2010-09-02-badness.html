  content: Something I ponder with regard to Phil Spector. His Christmas album is
    top five all-time albums for me, but then you read Ronnie Spector's book and the
    subsequent murder of an actress... somehow I can disassociate the two. Love the
    music, hate the man. Maybe, though, it's easier because mostly I'm not hearing
    him or his voice, just his production.

  content: "This is a great topic and one I think about alot in relation to both my
    love of sports/baseball and my work in media studies (and hopefully will one day
    explore more formally). My suggestion is that one way to think about sports or
    one methodology through which to analyze the significance of sports and the ideologies
    which sports convey is that of star studies. The most basic idea which I draw
    on from star studies is that stars act out aspects of social life that matter
    to us. So rather than asking what does a player have to do before we stop admiring
    their on field talent, we instead ask how do we deal with a player's transgressions?
    How do we construct them as a star BOTH in terms of their performance on field
    and their actions off the field as well as other aspects of their identity (race,
    gender, class, geography). The status of this hypothetical composer as a murderer
    may not make his concertos any less valubale but it does, or rather can effect
    how we read those concertos. In baseball, Barry Bonds is one of the best examples
    I can think of off the top of my head that fits into the paradigm of talented
    player on field, problematic personality off the field. I don't know anything
    about this Lueke kid but I would offer a few points to consider very briefly.
    1-- he's in the mariner's organization. All of this stuff would probably be constructed
    differently (or more actively constructed) by the broader baseball/sports community
    if he were a Yankee or a member of the Red Sox or any one of the handful of clubs
    that have that occupy that privileged space in the MLB cultural imaginary. 2--it
    all depends on what happens between now and when/if he makes the big leagues.
    He could conceivably become a redemption story or a Josh Hamilton-type figure.
    and 3-- we also have to consider the nature of the crime and the place that sexism
    and misogyny has in baseball and sports. This will affect how people respond to
    him, openly certainly he will be condemned but... I don't know and I can't quite
    articulate myself bc I don't want to shortchange male sports fans at the same
    time as I see and feel everyday how much sexism and misogyny there is, how sports
    fan communities treat women (not so much specific women as the idea of women)
    without seeing it as a problem.\r\nHopefully that made some sense... but regardless
    love the blog and really like the direction in which this post points!\r\nmabel."

  content: Okay, pedantry, but a murdering composer and a non-composing murder are
    different from each other in many respects; it's just in terms of being murderers
    that they're the same.

  content: I would forgive Andy Roddick for being a jerk if he won another major,
    so sportsmanship comes nowhere near the line.

  content: "Thanks for the comments. \r\n\r\nCraig: Phil Specter's real crime was
    ruining the Let it Be sessions\r\n\r\nMabel: Thanks so much for the thoughtful
    and thorough comment. I'm glad you like the blog and I hope you'll keep reading
    and participating. One thing I will point out is that you're right, I probably
    do have no real understanding of sexism in sports -- at least not on the level
    you do. It's a subject we should explore more here. Also, I think the idea of
    a more holistic approach to analyzing these questions is probably wise. I wonder
    if it's even possible to consider \"stars\" out of context. THen again Lueke is
    hardly a star.\r\n\r\nEmber: Yeah, I suppose I meant that they are the same as
    murderers. Not in all aspects.\r\n\r\nReeves: Sportsmanship is a little different
    because it comes in the context of the game, not outside it. Also, Andy Roddick
    is the great American hope. And that means something!"

  content: "Great question. Sorry to turn to the NFL... but a great example to consider
    is Ben Rothlisberger because sports fans' willingness to ignore off-field indiscretions
    in the face of in-game prowess is being debated. It's even somewhat quantifiable
    because the NFL's personal conduct rule gives the commissioner power to weigh
    public opinion then drop a punishment that meets expectations. \r\n\r\nThis question
    of how people compartmentalize is very interesting because everyone is so unique.
    I'm sure my true feelings about people and players comes from the dark depths
    of my unconscious mind, but I definitely have different standards for star athletes
    compared to politicians or non-athletic entertainers. If this blog were Politics
    &amp; Poets I'd probably suggest John Edwards as an interesting figure to discuss.
    (I know a recent podcast made forays into politics as Pitchers &amp; Presidents,
    nonetheless John Edwards and his love child might be a little too heavy for this
    medium of discussion.)"

<p>The question of badness amongst professional athletes has always fascinated me. The same goes for any celebrity -- writer, actor, musician. How to react when a person whose work you admire leads a life that is not up to your own personal standards. Is a murderer who writes beautiful violoncello concertos&nbsp; any different from a regular old murderer?</p>
<p>Obviously not. But that doesn't make his concertos any less valuable.&nbsp; Just as Mel Gibson's anti-Semitism doesn't make 'Braveheart' any less awesome, and Michael Richards' racism doesn't make 'Seinfeld' any less funny.&nbsp; Which brings us to Mariners' prospect Josh Lueke's <a href="http://seattletimes.nwsource.com/html/mariners/2012321497_lueke10.html">rape and sodomy charge</a>. It doesn't make his 96 mph fastball any less impressive.</p>
<p>I guess this is a question. To what extent can a person mess up before you quit admiring them? Or as a baseball executive, to what extent can a ballplayer run afoul with the law before you decide to stop paying them? Obviously off-field issues will have a greater effect on signability for maginal ballplayers, so let's stick to the stars, the geniuses.&nbsp; Let's discuss.</p>
