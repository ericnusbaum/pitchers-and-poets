  content: "1. Keith Herenandez obviously. That mustache is glorious, plus it makes
    great fodder for those sexist Just for Men commercials.\r\n3. David Cone.\r\n4.
    Carlos Zambrano, that fat bastard. \r\n9. Brooklyn Dodgers, cause brooklyn is
    where it's at."

  content: "1. Excluding Rollie Fingers, who has the greatest facial hair in the history
    of the game?\r\n\r\n- Bobby Valentine's fake mustachio.\r\n\r\n2. Least enviable
    inferior big league brother. Example: Wilton Guerrero.\r\n\r\n- Billy Ripken.
    He's Danny DeVito to Cal Ripken's Arnold from Twins. But hey, he's got a TV gig.\r\n\r\n3.
    Dave Stieb or David Cone?\r\n\r\n- Cone\r\n\r\n4. The game is on the line. You
    have to send a pitcher &ndash; any pitcher &ndash; to the plate. Who is it?\r\n\r\n-
    Big Z, Carlos Zambrano, a switch hitter for god's sakes, with a .238 career average.
    That's assuming we're not still counting Rick Ankiel as a pitcher...\r\n\r\n6.
    Bull Durham or Field of Dreams?\r\n\r\n- Field of Dreams. I could watch James
    Earl Jones brush the imaginary flies of memory away from his face on a loop for
    hours.\r\n\r\n7. Best local broadcast crew, excluding your hometown/favorite team?\r\n\r\n-
    Well, there's Vin Scully, the one-man broadcast crew, but that's too easy. I'll
    say the Giants' Duane Kuiper and Mike Krukow. Hilarious, insightful, energetic,
    and they're always on mlb.tv late night what with the time difference.\r\n\r\n8.
    Least deserving Hall of Famer?\r\n\r\n- Bob Lemon, that bum. Just kidding, I have
    no problems with Bob Lemon.\r\n\r\n9. If you could resurrect one dislocated or
    disbanded franchise, which?\r\n\r\n- The Expos, if only for the strangeness of
    that awful, empty stadium in what feels like an old European city.\r\n\r\n10.
    Most memorable instance of creative technique employed by manager in confrontation
    with umpire.\r\n\r\n- I'm a fan of the simple'turn the hat around so that you
    can get up in the ump's grill the better. Most notably from Bull Durham."

  content: "1.Excluding Rollie Fingers, who has the greatest facial hair in the history
    of the game?\r\n\r\n- I&rsquo;m just relieved that the great goatee crazy of the
    1990&rsquo;s in thankfully behind us\r\n\r\n2. Least enviable inferior big league
    brother. Example: Wilton Guerrero.\r\n\r\n- Ozzie Canseco is the obvious choice
    but I&rsquo;m going with Paul Dean due to the unfortunate barnyard incident he
    and Dizzy both valiantly tried to stop as children\r\n\r\n3. Dave Stieb or David
    Cone?\r\n\r\n- Cone\r\no\tThe only Met to deliver in 1988 NLCS\r\no\tDid a great
    bit with Letterman in 1988 making fun of Whitey Herzog&rsquo;s haircut\r\no\tJust
    this week attempt to defeat that vile den of backward thought know as the U.S.
    Supreme Court by testifying at Sotomayor&rsquo;s hearing \r\n\r\n4. The game is
    on the line. You have to send a pitcher &ndash; any pitcher &ndash; to the plate.
    Who is it?\r\n\r\n- Walter Johnson &ndash; people he was more than a man\r\n\r\n5.
    Favorite Casey Stengel managed ball club?\r\n\r\n- 1963 Mets &ndash; improved
    by 11 games over &rsquo;62 Mets!\r\n\r\n6. Bull Durham or Field of Dreams?\r\n\r\n-
    Bull Durham &ndash; mainly because I went to Bulls games and the Bull never assaulted
    my cousin; sadly I cannot say the same of the Winston-Salem Warthog\r\n\r\n7.
    Best local broadcast crew, excluding your hometown/favorite team?\r\n\r\n-Jon
    Miller doing radio (he once compared the skydome to the final set piece in Moonraker
    during the heart of the 1989 AL East pennant race &ndash; sublime)\r\n\r\n8. Least
    deserving Hall of Famer?\r\n\r\n- Without question Bowie Kuhn (amongst his many
    crimes: my father once asked him if he slept in the nude and Bowie refused to
    answer)\r\n\r\n9. If you could resurrect one dislocated or disbanded franchise,
    which?\r\n\r\n- Boston Braves; only to confront the twee and wholly insufferable
    Red Sox Nation with a serious psycho-sexual dilemma\r\n\r\n10. Most memorable
    instance of creative technique employed by manager in confrontation with umpire.\r\n\r\n-
    Anything ever done by Earl Weaver.  Read the article in the latest SI.  SI is
    like ESPN for people without head injuries."

  content: "3. Cone, because poetic types should be able to talk about pitchers who've
    actually pitched perfect games and not just nearly-perfect ones that represent
    the subjectivity and meaninglessness of the modern world or whatever.\r\n\r\n4.
    Zambrano. Or Babe Ruth?\r\n\r\n6. Field of Dreams, because I haven't seen Bull
    Durham.\r\n\r\n9. Brooklyn is a good choice, though my initial instinct was the
    Cleveland Spiders. I'd also support returning the Braves to Boston if and only
    if their mascot would make slightly more historical sense and cause slightly less
    protesting."

  content: "1. Dennis Eckersley...few can pull off a moustache of that nature. \r\n\r\n2.
    I am going with the sisterly version of this question. I always felt bad for Kit
    Keller. Dottie Henson was just too much of a superstar for the Rockford Peaches.
    (I certainly hope I do not have to explain the reference!)\r\n\r\n3. I'm throwing
    in a wild card. David Wells.....the only sport where you can be that fat and still
    throw a perfect game.\r\n\r\n4. Randy Johnson circa 1995 Game 5 ALDS M's vs. Yanks
    relief appearance. Entering a 4&ndash;4 game in the ninth, he pitched the 9th,
    10th, and 11th innings allowing 1 run, KO'd 6, and leading Seattle to the biggest
    victory in their history. \r\n\r\n6. Field of Dreams purely because of James Earl
    Jones. \r\n\r\n7. Ill say Vin Scully only because I know how much he means to
    the author of this blog...otherwise Dave Niehaus puts everyone else to shame.
    \r\n\r\n9. My answer will forever be the Seattle Supersonics (no matter the sport)\r\n\r\n10.
    Atlanta Braves minor league skipper. http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_Th_pTycmpY
    0:32 is the best part."

  content: "2. Least enviable inferior big league brother. Example: Wilton Guerrero.\r\n\r\nHope
    you don't mind sport jumping, but Brent Gretzky is easily the best for me. He
    is co-holder of the most NHL points ever scored by a pair of brothers with a combined
    2,861; Wayne had 2,857. Brent had 4.\r\n\r\n4. The game is on the line. You have
    to send a pitcher &ndash; any pitcher &ndash; to the plate. Who is it?\r\n\r\nNo
    one is taking Micah Owings and his .298 career batting average? Sign me up.\r\n\r\n7.
    Best local broadcast crew, excluding your hometown/favorite team?\r\n\r\nGary
    Thorne for the Baltimore Orioles. He brings a hockey-like intensity to the lovely
    game of baseball. \"SAKIC SCORES!\" or \"BASEHIT UP THE MIDDLE!\", its all money
    with Gary."

  content: "10. Cap Anson.  On August 10, 1883 Anson protested Moses Fleetwood Walker&rsquo;s
    participation in an exhibition game, he eventually gave in when he was threatened
    with losing the gate receipts.  Next time he was in Toledo in 1884 he had a signed
    contract preventing Walker from taking the field.\r\n\r\n9.  I kind of wish this
    question asked if I could kill or disband one franchise which would it be.  If
    I am forced to choose though, I will go with the Troy Trojans.  They played in
    the smallest city to ever have a major league sports team from 1879-1882, and
    only did so because the teams in New York City and Philadelphia had been kicked
    out for not completing their schedules.\r\n\r\n8.  Bill Mazerowski.  He has a
    .260 career batting average and 138 homeruns over 17 seasons.  He basically got
    into the Hall of Fame because of his defense and one homerun.  After his induction
    the Hall was ashamed by the lack of standards so they changed the Veteran&rsquo;s
    committee and no one has been elected via that method since.\r\n\r\n7. I have
    many problems with this question, especially the excluding the only people you
    really ever listen to part.  Also, I don&rsquo;t really like the crews part either,
    I generally hate one of the two guys.  This really doesn&rsquo;t answer the question
    but the best announcer in the game is Steve Stone and the worst is Hawk Harrelson.
    \ I gave you one crew at least.\r\n\r\n6. For Love of the Game\r\n\r\n5. Boston
    Braves/Bees.  No reason really I just love old Braves Field, it was designed with
    the dead ball area in mind at the dawn of the live ball area.\r\n\r\n4. Do you
    need a homerun, drive two guys in from second and third, or a bunt single to start
    a big rally?  Wait it does not matter.  Just ask Wade Miller, the answer is Carlos
    Zambrano.  Hit the gaming winning homerun in his last two wins, drove in the Cubs
    only run in regulation in his start before that.  He has the most homeruns of
    any pitcher in the DH era with 19 and at 28 is only half way to the all-time mark.\r\n\r\n3.
    Dave Stieb.  It was tough both did not play for the Cubs.  Cone played for the
    Mets and Stieb played for the White Sox.  However, Stieb did play the majority
    of his career in Exhibition Stadium so he gets the nod.  Oh outdoor baseball in
    Canada, Twins fans enjoy April 2010.\r\n\r\n2. Paul Rueschel.  He had under 400
    career innings and was the larger of the two Rueschel brothers which is really
    saying something.  The great majority of his career came with the Chicago Cubs.
    \ He came up three years after his younger brother and pitched in his shadow for
    his best 3 &frac12; season in the majors, which still weren&rsquo;t very good.
    \ In 1977, Tops printed a brother&rsquo;s card with Paul and Rick both on it,
    the only problem was they switched up the names.  Tops knew about the error but
    cared so little they never changed it. \r\n\r\n1. Initially because of my blatant
    Cubs bias I was leaning towards Sandberg&rsquo;s &rsquo;87 spring training mustache
    but let&rsquo;s be honest remember those crazy designs Mike Piazza put into his
    beard in the late 90&rsquo;s with the Mets?  I want to call it gay but I figure
    Piazza would hold a press conference to refute it."

  content: "4 &ndash; A smart aleck answer would be Babe Ruth.  A better answer is
    that it would depend on the situation.  For example, for a bunt, it would be Greg
    Maddux.  I don&rsquo;t know about singles.  While an obvious answer for home runs
    is Carlos Zambrano, he can be pitched to fairly easily in close situations late
    in the game.  Carlos swings too hard (i.e., he doesn&rsquo;t &ldquo;stay within
    himself&rdquo;), so a smart pitcher can get him.  He is only about 1 for 10 while
    pinchhitting.\r\n\r\n6 &ndash; Field of Dreams.  I have been there.  It&rsquo;s
    great.  And it&rsquo;s free (or at least it was).\r\n\r\n7 &ndash; Who cares.\r\n\r\n8
    &ndash; Freddie Lindstrom.\r\n\r\n9 &ndash; Troy Haymakers &ndash; smallest town
    ever to have a major league team."

    Brooklyn Dodgers. I'm a Brooklyn boy and I would love to have seen them play.\r\n\r\n10.

    Seattle Pilots. I think that market needs a second baseball team. \r\n\r\n10.

    \ It's bad enough if you have one brother who's way better than you but to have
    two or more is on another level.\r\n\r\n3. Stieb\r\n\r\n4. Discounting any pitchers
    who wound up playing as regulars at another position, Bob Lemon. Currently, Owings
    has to be the pick.\r\n\r\n5. I don't want to go with a Yankees team but the rest
    of his teams are only memorable for being awful, so I guess I'll have to pick
    the 1951 Yankees with the changeover from DiMaggio to Mantle, plus Johnny Mize.\r\n\r\n6.
    Field of Dreams\r\n\r\n7. Don't really have one.\r\n\r\n8. Morgan Bulkeley. President
    of the National League for its first year but didn't do much of anything.\r\n\r\n9.
    The Providence Grays. Just because there's nothing you can do with gray to make
    it interesting, especially when every team wears gray on the road anyway.\r\n\r\n10.
    The Braves minor-league manager could have won if he cut his act by just a little
    bit.  It wound up being overdone even though the grenade act was probably the
    most original single action I've ever seen. Otherwise, it's the previously mentioned
    Bobby Valentine facial hair."

  content: "1- Jeff Bagwell's mid to late 90s goa-tee could've rivaled ZZ Top's\r\n\r\n2-
    Ozzie Canseco (exactly...huh, who?) for identical twins Jose sure got all the
    power, Ozzie had a whooping 0 bombs in his few years of sporadic games in the
    bigs inbetween long minor league power dominances\r\n\r\n3- David Cone BY FAR.
    Not a knock on Dave Steib at all who was a good pitcher in his own right, but
    come on...5 Rings, a perfecto, and a Cy Young\r\n\r\n4- Other than the obvious
    early Babe Ruth. I'd say that Micah Owings would probably pinch hit for power
    better than most bench players out there.  He could pull off the next \"Rich Ankiel\"
    move if his pitching doesn't improve soon.\r\n\r\n5- The 1954 Yanks. Casey managed
    so many HOFers and great players on this team that swept the Indians who were
    national league then in the Series. He had Mantle, Rizzuto, Berra, Ford, Enos
    Slaughter off the bench wow.  I love his line, \"Managing is getting paid for
    homeruns someone else hits.\" I'm sure that applied in '54 really well for him.\r\n\r\n6-
    Tough call 2 great movies (Costner's only decent ones in my opinion) but Bull
    Durham wins out for me because of the comedic value of the behind the game type
    stuff like the chit chat of the whole infield's conversations during mound visits,
    etc\r\n\r\n7- Being a Dodger fan its hard not to pick Scully but since I can't,
    the Joe Morgan &amp; Jon Miller combo for the dreaded Giants (blah) games are
    very entertaining. Must be why espn uses them for their primetime broadcasts\r\n\r\n8-
    Roger Bresnahan definitely doesn't have anywhere close to H.O.F. stats although
    he did popularize modern catching equipment his 26, YES!, 26 career homers/530rbi/.279avg
    over 17 seasons while being a great and versatile fielder just does not add up
    to enough to mention only 1 post season and a losing record as a manager\r\n\r\n9-
    Not a big league move but I used to love going to Peninsula Pilots games as they
    once were the single A affiliate of the Mariners in Hampton, VA. They moved to
    Delaware I think, back in '93. Now they use the really OLD stadium for a young
    local independent semi-pro team which is cool but not quite the same. AAAANNNNDD
    also, if I could play Bud Selig/God for a day I would have Arte Moreno sell back
    his L.A. title back to Mayor Villaraigso and keep it strictly \"Anaheim\" again.\r\n\r\n10-
    That minor league manager a couple years ago that went absolutely crazy by screaming
    at the ump in a tirade then covered the plate with dirt, picking up and throwing
    bases and then throwing imaginary gernades while army crawling through the infield
    was completely ridiculous to see. Still entertaining to look up on you-tube from
    time to time"

  content: "1. Ken Caminiti had some real aggressive facial hair. He looked like a
    tweaked out biker who just spent the past three years lifting weights in San Quentin
    or Pelican Bay. \r\n2. My first thought is Billy Ripken, though maybe it should
    be Mike Maddux. The real answer has to be Ozzie Canseco, right? Was Ozzie Canseco
    an identical twin? Because career minor leaguer versus borderline/potential hall
    famer (or at least Jose would be if he didn't rub so many people the wrong way)
    has to be the be the biggest discrepancy between two baseball brothers with (potentially)
    identical genes. Ramon Martinez was probably the best lesser brother in recent
    memory.\r\n3. It seems like Cone had the longer career, being with those Mets
    teams early, the Blue Jays in the middle, and Yankees late in his career.\r\n4.
    Well the obvious answer is Babe Ruth, isn't it? Excluding him, I remember Fernando
    and Orel being good hitters, especially with 1988 Orel outhitting Canseco (aside
    from his monster home run in game one, and I don't mean Ozzie).\r\n5. Miracle
    Mets? Stengel was way before my time.\r\n6. I have never seen Field of Dreams.
    Bull Durham by default. Eight Men Out is by far my favorite sports movie.\r\n7.
    I only know the Dodger and Angel broadcast crews, best known for Vin Scully and
    Rex Hudler respectively. Can you guess which one I like and which one I don't?\r\n8.
    Everyone who played prior to integration is not deserving if you want to honest
    about it. Relief pitchers are probably undeserving as well. Bill Mazerowski?\r\n9.
    Les Expos.\r\n10. Taking the base and either throwing it, or taking it with you
    to the clubhouse."

    Don Newcombe wasn't bad, Mike Hampton or Kenny Brett\r\n\r\n5. 49 Yankees, just

    I believe."
