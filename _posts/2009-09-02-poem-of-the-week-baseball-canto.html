  content: Getting to this one late&mdash;been insanely occupied with family stuff.
    But wow, an intense one. Lots of intense 1950s race speak in there. I like it.

<p>This week's poem comes a day late, but you know, at least it's here. It's a canto in the tradition of Ezra Pound, featuring an allusion to Ezra Pound, and written by Lawrence Ferlinghetti. Ferlinghetti is (I'm pretty sure) a Giants fan, which is a bummer, but his life's work in writing and advocating literature makes up for it. He founded City Lights Books in San Francisco, palled around with fantasy baseball fan&nbsp; Jack Kerouac, and published Ginsberg's Howl.&nbsp; Here's his poem, Baseball Canto:</p>
<blockquote><p>
Watching baseball, sitting in the sun, eating popcorn,<br />
reading Ezra Pound,<br />
and wishing that Juan Marichal would hit a hole right through the<br />
Anglo-Saxon tradition in the first Canto<br />
and demolish the barbarian invaders.<br />
When the San Francisco Giants take the field<br />
and everybody stands up for the National Anthem,<br />
with some Irish tenor's voice piped over the loudspeakers,<br />
with all the players struck dead in their places<br />
and the white umpires like Irish cops in their black suits and little<br />
black caps pressed over their hearts,<br />
Standing straight and still like at some funeral of a blarney bartender,<br />
and all facing east,<br />
as if expecting some Great White Hope or the Founding Fathers to<br />
appear on the horizon like 1066 or 1776.</p>
<p>But it don't stop nobody this time,<br />
in their revolution round the loaded white bases,<br />
in this last of the great Anglo-Saxon epics,<br />
in the territorial libre of Baseball.<br />
But Willie Mays appears instead,<br />
in the bottom of the first,          and a roar goes up as he clouts the first one into the sun and takes          off, like a foot runner from Thebes.<br />
The ball is lost in the sun and maidens wail after him<br />
as he keeps running through the Anglo-Saxon epic.<br />
And Tito Fuentes comes up looking like a bullfighter<br />
in his tight pants and small pointy shoes.<br />
And the right field bleachers go mad with Chicanos and blacks          and Brooklyn beer-drinkers,<br />
"Tito! Sock it to him, sweet Tito!"<br />
And sweet Tito puts his foot in the bucket<br />
and smacks one that don't come back at all,<br />
and flees around the bases          like he's escaping from the United Fruit Company.<br />
As the gringo dollar beats out the pound.<br />
And sweet Tito beats it out like he's beating out sury,<br />
not to mention fascism and anti-Semitism.<br />
And Juan Marichal comes up,          and the Chicano bleachers go loco again,          as Juan belts the first ball out of sight,          and rounds first and keeps going<br />
and rounds second and rounds third,<br />
and keeps going and hits pay dirt<br />
to the roars of the grungy populace.<br />
As some nut presses the backstage panic button<br />
for the tape-recorded National Anthem again,<br />
to save the situation.</p></blockquote>
