  content: "Nice job, Ted. I think you've hit on something -- that a couple of old-schoolers,
    Ryan and Washington, riding herd on young millionaires in this relatively young
    baseball market might be a recipe with some staying power. GM Jon Daniels is also
    something new -- a guy who loves the numbers AND loves the scouts: he's old/new
    school.\r\nAnd I think you're right about the way things operate in NY and Boston.
    Kevin Millar was tolerated because the Sox won. If they'd fallen short, he'd have
    been run out of town as a clown who didn't \"play the game the right way.\"\r\nAnd
    here's the craziest part: down here in Texas, the Rangers, enjoying a day off
    as the only undefeated team in baseball, have pushed the Dallas Cowboys to Page
    2."

  content: "Thanks, Larry, I take your endorsement seriously when it comes to the
    Rangers. I must admit I don't know a lot about Daniels. He seems to have the same
    balanced outlook that the whole team does, big surprise.\r\n\r\nRe: Millar, yep."

  content: "I first took notice of the Rangers last spring on the MLB Extra Innings
    Package. A lot of young talent, and a fun team to watch. I wish Ryan success with
    what he's trying with the pitchers, in part because he was a favorite player of
    mine, and in part because, if he's right about pitchers' arms, baseball will be
    a better game.\r\n\r\nI'm a loyal Pirates fan, and became a documented alien in
    Red Sox nation when I lived there, but I'm keeping one eye on the Rangers as a
    team to watch when the Pirates aren't on."

  content: "While we're on the subject, let's be clear about what Ryan is advocating.
    He's not against pitch counts. He's against applying the same pitch count -- say,
    100 -- to all pitchers. He wants his manager to take into account the pitcher's
    age, experience, history, his last start, the opposition, the weather, and decide
    how many pitches he should throw on *that* day.\r\n\r\nAnd he's against starting
    pitchers thinking they've done their job when they get 15 outs. He knows none
    of his pitchers should ever throw 259 pitches in one game, as Ryan once did. His
    stated goal his second year as team president was to have all pitchers strive
    to go about an inning longer per start than they had the previous year. In 2007,
    Ranger starters went 5.2 innings. This year, after 6 games, it's 6.3. And that's
    Ryan's wild idea in a nutshell: just give me one more inning."

  content: Just discovered the site, tremendous writing.  Like the Josh Hamilton descriptions.  Looking
    forward to reading more.

<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2763" title="nolan ryan" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/nolan-ryan.png" alt="" width="600" height="406" />At least some part of the public persona of the Texas Rangers as a baseball club is rooted in the assumption that barrel-chested El Presidente Nolan Ryan is watching. The camera frequently finds him in his seat at games, beside his perfectly touched up Texas beauty queen of a wife, watching his team play like a ranch foreman overseeing his hands bring in a herd of cattle. The Ryan Express is, in my imagination at least, noting every lack of hustle and sign of weakness that he sees from his players, and recording it in a dusty card catalogue in his brain for later dressings down. No other MLB team executive commands such an authoritative presence, especially with Mr. Steinbrenner passed on.</p>
<p>The Rangers did right by Ryan last year, with their run to the World Series, and with an undefeated start to the 2011 season through April 6, they seem poised to take the AL West division again.</p>
<p>But there's a paradox in play. Where their most visible executive is an old school cowboy of a player who despises pitch counts, the Rangers themselves are a charismatic, crowd-friendly team with a cast of characters you'd more likely find at a bar at midnight than at the ballpark on a Sunday afternoon. The Rangers' best hitter, Josh Hamilton, is a <a title="josh hamilton recovering addict" href="http://sports.espn.go.com/mlb/news/story?id=2926447">recovering addict</a> with flame tattoos up and down his forearms, Manager Ron Washington ha<a title="ron washington cocaine" href="http://sportsillustrated.cnn.com/2010/baseball/mlb/03/17/washington/index.html">s tested positive for some pretty hard drugs</a>, and lefty starter C.J. Wilson is an&nbsp;<a title="c.j. wilson web site" href="http://leftylefty.com/">adrenaline junky</a> who's hooked on <a title="c.j. wilson str8edgeracer twitter" href="http://twitter.com/#!/str8edgeracer">Twitter</a>. (Nolan Ryan's thinks twittering is what the ladies do when they get together after church. Hey-o!) The team developed a couple of hand signals just for fun, the claw and the antlers, to celebrate good plays on their run to the World Series. This would've gotten you shanked if you'd tried those kind of shenanigans in the Bob Gibson era. Just ask Robin Ventura about respecting the game. (Sidenote: Dave Sims let me know on the Mariners broadcast that the Rangers still play footage of Nolan Ryan mashing Robin Ventura's face before games.)</p>
<p><del>Madness without discipline is just madness.</del></p>
<p>This odd couple leadership structure, with austerity and tradition up top and playfulness further down the line, creates a nice push and pull between the traditional and the contemporary for the Rangers, of the sort that breeds success not only in baseball, but at companies like Google and even in artists. Creativity thrives in circumstances when creative energy is constrained by outward pressures. Madness without discipline is just madness.</p>
<p>The word I would use to describe the Rangers as a team is <em>balance</em>. The lineup has a fine ratio of speed and power, including a lot of power. Ron Washington's honest and likable approach balances out the big personalities on the team and in the front office. He doesn't go too far in one direction or the other even as the media tries to stir up stories. The hitters in this lineup are cool, comfortable, and unflappable, from Hamilton--who one imagines has seen corners of the country so dark that a major league strikeout is a chocolate milkshake in comparison--to fearless and friendly Adrian Beltre. Even the pitching on this team has outgrown the old big hit, no-pitch&nbsp;Rangers stereotype.</p>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-2766" title="texas rangers ron washington" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/04/texas-rangers-ron-washington.png" alt="texas rangers ron washington" width="600" height="397" />There are whole libraries devoted to the chemistry of great baseball teams, insisting that planets of personality align perfectly to activate some kind of mystically ordained success. But this Rangers group--which I'll stop short of calling great and call very good--may prove the anti-theory, played out in Little League and the major leagues, that winning teams have good chemistry because they are good, and that bad teams have bad chemistry because losing sucks. The Michael Young mini-saga, for example, evaporated in the Arlington heat as soon as Nelson Cruz hit a home run in each of the first four games of the season, the minute Ian Kinsler popped a few out himself and stole a base or two, and just as quickly as Neftali Feliz ambled out to the mound and closed out a ballgame as calmly as your average cubicle jockey finishing off a Friday afternoon.</p>
<p>Two of the iconic teams in baseball, the Yankees and the Red Sox, play in a crucible of scrutiny and fanaticism, from the front office&nbsp;to the highest seat in the nosebleeds. In those climes, jocularity is a kind of blemish, a sign of weakness in the face of the game's most unrelenting pressures.</p>
<p>In Arlington, jocularity is a badge. The smiles rise as the baseball flies. The only one who isn't smiling is Nolan Ryan. He doesn't pay himself to smile.</p>
