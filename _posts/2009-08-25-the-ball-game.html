<p>This week's poem by <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Robert_Creeley">Robert Creeley</a> comes to us via <a href="http://thegoodform.wordpress.com/">The Good Form</a>,&nbsp; a blog "where sports and poetry meet to talk it out." The kind (and kindredly spirited) folks over there contacted us a few weeks ago, and we're sorry it took this long to introduce you. Anyway, they present Creeley's poem in the context of a kind of funny, but kind of morbid story about a rainy Saturday night spent in the company of the <a href="http://thegoodform.wordpress.com/2009/08/20/nats-baseball-open-letter-of-ire-and-robert-creeleys-baseball/">Padres and Nationals</a>.&nbsp; As for me, I'm still trying to figure out what exactly old Bob Creeley is trying to say here:</p>
<p><strong>*Update: Ted found this mp3 of Creeley reading the poem out loud:<a href="http://media.sas.upenn.edu/pennsound/authors/Creeley/Black-Mountain_c-1954/Creeley-Robert_19_The-Ball-Game_Black-Mtn_c-1954.mp3"> <em>Robert Creeley -- The Ball Game</em></a></strong></p>

<em>Likewise out of the park</em></em></p>
<p><em>of our own indifferent vulgarity, not</em><em><br />
<em>mind you, that one repents even the most visual</em><br />
<em>satisfaction</em></em>.<br />
<em><br />
<em>Early in life the line is straight</em><br />
<em>made straight</em><br />
<em>against the grain.</em></em></p>
<p><em>Take the case of myself, and why not</em><em><br />
<em>since these particulars need</em><br />
<em>no further impetus,</em><br />
<em>take me at the age of 13</em><br />
<em>and for some reason there, no matter the particular</em><br />
<em>reason.</em></em></p>
<p><em> The one damn time (7th inning)</em><em><br />
