<p>This week a poem by a guy you may have actually heard of. "Baseball" is from John Updike's final poetry collection -- <em>Endpoint.</em>. The poem lopes along nicely,  like a midweek summer day game somewhere in the middle of America. "There is no hiding from baseball," Updike writes. Whether sitting on a barstool, or standing in center field, I doubt truer words have been said about the game. Enjoy:</p>
<blockquote><p>It looks easy from a distance,<br />
easy and lazy, even,<br />
until you stand up to the plate<br />
and see the fastball sailing inside,<br />
an inch from your chin,<br />
or circle in the outfield<br />
straining to get a bead<br />
on a small black dot<br />
a city block or more high,<br />
a dark star that could fall<br />
on your head like a leaden meteor.</p>
<p>The grass, the dirt, the deadly hops<br />
between your feet and overeager glove:<br />
football can be learned,<br />
and basketball finessed, but<br />
there is no hiding from baseball<br />
the fact that some are chosen<br />
and some are not&mdash;those whose mitts<br />
feel too left-handed,<br />
who are scared at third base<br />
of the pulled line drive,<br />
and at first base are scared<br />
of the shortstop's wild throw<br />
that stretches you out like a gutted deer.</p>
<p>There is nowhere to hide when the ball's<br />
spotlight swivels your way,<br />
and the chatter around you falls still,<br />
and the mothers on the sidelines,<br />
your own among them, hold their breaths,<br />
and you whiff on a terrible pitch<br />
or in the infield achieve<br />
something with the ball so<br />
ridiculous you blush for years.<br />
It's easy to do. Baseball was<br />
invented in America, where beneath<br />
the good cheer and sly jazz the chance<br />
of failure is everybody's right,<br />
beginning with baseball.</p>
