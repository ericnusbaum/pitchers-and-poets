<h1><a href="http://newcenturypicnic.com/rbi/index.php?title=The_Cosmic_Carom">The Cosmic Carom</a></h1>
<p>When an infielder responds to missing a grounder through the legs via a bad bounce by staring dejectedly to the heavens, as if to blame the orbiting moon and prevailing gravities for affecting the path of the ground ball. The head back, wide-legged stare is held long enough to convey victimhood, but just short of interrupting regular cutoff-man duties for fear of angering the baseball gods further.</p>
<p>Similar to <a title="I'm At A Loss" href="http://newcenturypicnic.com/rbi/index.php?title=I%27m_At_A_Loss">I'm At A Loss</a>, as both events are tragic outcomes born from the routine.</p>

<p>The outfield equivalent of the Cosmic Carom, the yin tot the <a title="I'm At A Loss" href="http://newcenturypicnic.com/rbi/index.php?title=I%27m_At_A_Loss">I'm At A Loss</a> yang. With a runner on second base, an outfielder charges a base hit with "outfield assist" on his mind. Should thoughts of unloading the canon supersede thoughts of fielding the batted ball, the Hidden Chin will result. The ball sneaks under the fielders glove, rolling unmolested to the fence. The fielder stops, turns, and sprints head down to retrieve.</p>
