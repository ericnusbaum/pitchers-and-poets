  content: "Man, I love crappy rock bands and I love Shaun Marcum. Only wish he'd
    gone full beard earlier.\r\n\r\nThe Jays have some candidates...Eric Thames rocks
    a 70s sideburns look, Jose Bautista's beard is legendary and Travis Snider recently
    shaved this thing - http://tinyurl.com/688p7jo - leaving him looking more Linklater
    than Ron Jeremy nowadays.\r\n\r\nThe one that kinda bugs me on your good list
    is Vlad. Just like he's no longer a top 5 player, I don't think his style has
    held up. Maybe it's the short hair."

  content: "Ted, you are a man after my own heart. Fashion/style and baseball, together?
    Two of my favorite things. \r\nWe might also consider walk up music as part of
    the conversation. \r\nMy comment however is that we should also connect the look
    of a player to political meanings and broader issues of especially racial identity,
    identity politics and the role of MLB in policing those both explicitly and implicitly.
    There's a column by Todd Boyd from a few years ago over at ESPN.com that touches
    on some of the issues at stake in terms of the politics of style, MLB's conservatism
    and the decline of blacks in baseball. http://sports.espn.go.com/espn/page2/story?page=boyd/070702\r\nThere
    he emphasizes how basketball, empitomized by players like Dr. J, became a public
    site in which  black identity could be displayed through both athletic performance
    style and visual appearance. MLB, both as an institution and in individual clubs,
    on the other hand, has long had a much more complex relationship to style and
    the spectacular individual, especially the spectacular black individual, the persona
    of so many black stars has been critiqued for being too flashy, an aesthetic that
    flies in the face of everything MLB wants to stand for and how it wants to operate--
    management controlling and disciplining teams and players. (This is not to say
    that MLB and MLB clubs haven't had issues with flashy white players but the political
    dynamics are necessarily distinct.) \r\nI have often wondered about the seemingly
    changing attitudes toward tattoos in MLB, which though ostensibly governed by
    the \"Justin Miller Rule\" seem to be inconsistently enforced. Would those rules
    have been differently enforced if it had been predominantly black players with
    tattoos? White players with tattoos connote not gangs but alternative culture,
    just what MLB seems to be courting with teams like the SFGiants. \r\nAnother curious
    case in point is Dontrelle Willis who was told not to wear his hat cocked to the
    side. Whether or not a racial slight, it certainly gave the message that style
    had no place in MLB. \r\n\r\nUndoubtedly many would accuse me of reading too much
    into both style and the racial politics of MLB (if we're talking styleblogs check
    out http://iheartthreadbared.wordpress.com/ for excellent insights into how interrelated
    and how not trivial those things are). Those mentioned above are just a few examples
    which upon closer scrutiny might well turn out to be unfair readings. Nonetheless,
    the relationships between style, star persona, race and sport/MLB can productively
    be interrogated to examine the visual politics of the national pastime. (sorry
    that last sentence totally sounded like I'm writing an academic paper.)"

  content: "When I think of style in baseball, I immediately think of the pants and
    socks as the most important component. And, as a big fan of uni-watch.com, I naturally
    think that all players ever should be wearing stirrups. But the exact arrangement
    of the socks and pants, more than anything, defines a player stylistically, perhaps
    second only to facial hair. There, you've got real heroes and villians - Nyjer
    Morgan, Reed Johnson, Ubaldo Jimenez, being heroes, Manny and pretty much everyone
    else being the villians. The evolution of the sock and pants set-up is, for me,
    by far the most interesting part of the baseball uniform evolution.\r\n\r\nIt's
    interesting to think about the long pants as part of maybe a valid stylistic choice,
    and one wonders how it came about. (I'm not being entirely unserious when I say
    that I wonder if hipster skinny pants ever played a role, at least in a much broader
    cultural sense. And, uh, yeah, I wear skinny hipster pants.) My gut reaction is
    to say, \"We should be preserving something that's so unique to baseball uniforms,
    preserving this tradition - any sport can wear pants, but how many have such beautiful
    hoisery?\" And I'd still much rather see it that way - nevertheless, it worth
    wondering if in part it's part of a larger unconscious effort to suppress current
    culture, African-American or not, and that, in a sense, we're suppressing a valid
    style of the age. (If only Griffey chose once to wear his hat backwards during
    a game.) It's the fashion of the era, as every era has to have, and despite baseball
    sticking to tradition, as stirrups remained a staple until the 90s, plenty of
    other things came and went that people had a chance to complain about. I just
    hope it's not permanent and doesn't erase that \"history of hosiery.\" Hopefully,
    50s years from now, teams will be having retro days at the ballpark with long,
    baggy pants, lithium necklaces, and cool-flo helmets, and announcers will remark
    on how kids these days with their colorful stirrups, baggy pants, and solid-color-top-alternate-less
    jerseys don't remember how the old school guys did it in the 2000s and 2010s.\r\n\r\nAnother
    final thought: With my hopes that stirrups will return, has there ever been a
    style that has come in and out? Usually the uniforms simply evolve - for example,
    stirrups are established in the 20s or so, Ted Wiliams and the like bring their
    socks higher, clothes get tighter in the 60s,  stirrups get super high and thin
    in the 70s and 80s, pants go ankle length in the 90s and by the early 2000s, everyone's
    wearing long pants which slowly become more and more baggy as the decade goes
    on. There hasn't been one \"fad\" - say, long, baggy pants - that's simply gone
    in and out of style. Instead, it's progressed - which makes me a bit pessimistic.
    As much as I love Ubaldo's uniform choices, it seems unlikely that they'll usher
    in a wave of simply returning to stirrups - it's a bit more complicated then that."

    has come in and out: buttons. Practically ever team except the Yankees were wearing
    pull-overs at some point or another, but the teams themselves chose to go back
    to tradition and use buttons on their uniforms. So maybe there''s hope.'

  content: "@Brian, we've definitely gotten to the point where the quirky detail alone
    does not make a style icon. It can be a part of it, but the player must take it
    further than simply that. That said, I just realized that all of my most stylish
    players have some kind of facial hair.\r\n\r\n@Mabel, you have elevated the conversation,
    as usual, and all of your queries are intriguing and bear much more thought. \r\n\r\n@dougie,
    everything you said was drowned out by that Travis Snider mustache.\r\n\r\n@Rube,
    sometimes I feel like the high stirrups look is a way for only semi-stylish people
    to pretend that they have a distinct look. There was a time, early on, when Chipper
    Jones, for example, looked cool in the high stirrups, before every college kid
    started wearing them high. Thanks for all of your thoughts, really enjoyed them."

<p>Fashion blogs are all over the Internet these days, from the <a title="sartorialist" href="http://www.thesartorialist.blogspot.com/">Sartorialist's</a> style-making streetside photos to <a title="1990s first basemen week" href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/category/1990s-first-baseman-week//">1990s First Basemen Week</a> contributor Jesse Thorn and his men's fashion blog&nbsp;<a title="put this on" href="http://putthison.com/">Put This On</a>. Troops of <a title="bill cunningham" href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bill_Cunningham_(photographer)">professionals</a> and weekend stylists scour the streets of Brooklyn and the world snapping portraits of youths in leather shoes and old men in double-breasted suits. I enjoy these image-heavy style blogs. Their subjects are often idiosyncratic and interesting and more bold than your average Joe. <a title="mister mort" href="http://mistermort.typepad.com/">Mister Mort</a>, one of my favorites,&nbsp;finds some real characters whose style often includes just one fantastic adornment amidst an ensemble of crazy.</p>
<p>With Mort's work being a more extreme example, style blogs chronicle this continual tension between the traditional, the contemporary, and the futuristic.&nbsp;Baseball fields are another such battleground, where a few intrepid sports put heat to the glass of tradition and warp it into some novel shape. Others, in my humble opinion, succumb to the overwhelming weight of skewed tradition and/or mediocrity. In any event, I've got my opinions, and that's what I'll do here.</p>
<p>And so, taking my own turn at the wheel, I present the <strong>Pitchers &amp; Poets Style Academy, Volume 1</strong>, in which I decide for myself which players' style on-the-field sets them apart, and which players' stand out for their sourness.</p>
<p><em>Note</em>: In this volume, I am taking into account only on-field presentation. I am not bold enough to venture into what some of these dudes wear in their privatest times (<a title="troy tulowitzki" href="http://yfrog.com/klx4axrj">Exhibit A</a>).</p>
<h1>Fashion Five: The Height of Style</h1>
<h2>Ichiro Suzuki</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3702" title="ichiro suzuki style 1 yahoo" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/ichiro-suzuki-style-1-yahoo.png" alt="" width="464" height="654" />Ichiro, whose style has personified the Japanese look in America for a solid decade now, creates harmony among the disparate elements that comprise his rig. A glint of silver in his high tops echoes the shimmer of his batting gloves, which in turn calls out to the silver in the Mariners cap. The neat crest of his pant leg where it meets the high sock, and the close fit of his jersey on his narrow frame accentuate the speed that comes with the silver lining.</p>
<h2>Jose Reyes</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3704" title="jose reyes style 1 yahoo" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/jose-reyes-style-1-yahoo.png" alt="" width="600" height="411" />Dreadlocks are more commonplace now than ever, and now that Manny Ramirez has retired, they can return to respectability as a charming style component, best displayed by Reyes, the kinetic, quick-footed shortstop. What better to trail a speedster as he takes the extra base, like built-in <a title="jose reyes hair" href="http://www.metsblog.com/wordpress/wp-content/uploads/AP110414018744-480x524.jpg">motion lines</a>?&nbsp;Reyes' modern baggy pants also reflect his <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/players/7066/photos;_ylt=Alx1.kPKWNnnoe4L8xZYf1SFCLcF#photoViewer=urn%3Anewsml%3Asports.yahoo%2Cgetty%3A20050301%3Amlb%2Cphoto%2C052f0cb7d20b8ca573b185d4640ea677-getty-117117442%3A1">kinetic style</a>.</p>
<h2>Jayson Werth</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3706" title="jayson werth style 1 yahoo" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/jayson-werth-style-1-yahoo.png" alt="" width="600" height="405" />Proprietor of the beard with <a href="http://twitter.com/#!/JWerthsBeard">its own Twitter feed</a>, Jayson Werth pulls off dramatic facial hair while maintaining a sense of decorum that a showman like Brian Wilson jettisoned long ago. While Wilson clings to the meme that began last year, letting his boot polish bristle expand, Werth doesn't fear change, and he's known to trim down to a soul patch (causing his Twitter doppelganger to enter SOUL PATCH MODE). Beard aside, Werth's pants and jersey are of a full cut that looks back to an&nbsp;<a href="http://assets.nydailynews.com/img/2009/09/06/gal_lou_gehrig_13.jpg">age-old style</a> while remaining contemporary.</p>
<h2>Vladimir Guerrero</h2>
<p>[caption id="attachment_3708" align="aligncenter" width="444" caption="photo by Keith Allison"]<a href="http://www.flickr.com/photos/keithallison/5708962307/"><img class="size-full wp-image-3708" title="vladimir guerrero style" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/vladimir-guerrero-style.png" alt="" width="444" height="532" /></a>[/caption]</p>
<p>For decades, now, this man mountain's visual style has worked in perfect tandem with the way he plays baseball. Who else could successfully tuck his pant cuffs into his high tops but a player of Vlad's trademark aggressive effectiveness. Guerrero's giant legs help the idiosyncratic gambit succeed. Subtract batting gloves, add pine tar, finger tape, and one of the very few <a href="http://sports.yahoo.com/mlb/photos?slug=59e8dd217a1263901fac2676f6f64c35-getty-109237380gf001_baltimore_or">successful chin-only goatees</a>, and the swing-away vision of Vlad is complete.</p>
<h2>Mike Napoli</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3710" title="mike napoli style" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/mike-napoli-style.png" alt="" width="600" height="412" />I don't necessarily agree with Mike Napoli's style. I'm not a gold chain guy. But I respect the completeness of the effort. Chain, tightly bounded beard, ornamental arm tats, hair flowing from his helmet, wide red armtape. If Russell Crowe played a major leaguer, I would expect to see the same full-bodied commitment to the aesthetic. Not since Piazza's handlebar mustache has a catcher so boldly defied the aesthetic limitations of life behind the mask.</p>

<h1>Fashion Five Hole: The Dregs</h1>
<h2>Luke Scott</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3719" title="luke scott style sunglasses" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/luke-scott-style-sunglasses.png" alt="" width="600" height="472" />I'm not immune to the impact of Luke Scott's <a href="http://hardballtalk.nbcsports.com/2011/04/21/looking-deeper-at-luke-scott/">politics</a> when evaluating his look, but it seems fair to say that his style choices hint at his strange brew of ideas and behaviors. For years, his <a href="http://www.chron.com/photos/2007/03/01/5605983/226xRefer.jpg">sideburns</a> have been cut higher than a Monty Burns <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Lzpk5dMhVE4">employee</a>, and the snug fit of his <a href="http://cbsbaltimore.files.wordpress.com/2010/12/luke.jpg?w=400">jersey top</a> and his devotion to gaudy<a href="http://assets.nydailynews.com/img/2011/05/06/alg_orioles_luke_scott.jpg"> Oakley sunglasses</a> suggests an unhealthy attachment to the Reagan Era. And, of late, some kind of<br />
<a href="http://www.baltimoresun.com/sports/orioles/bal-bs-sp-orioles-raysna20110612163652,0,7491749.photo">mullet thing</a> has been seen creeping out of the back of his helmet. Also, <a href="http://cdn2.sbnation.com/fan_shot_images/32545/45096180.jpg">this</a>.</p>
<h2>Josh Beckett</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3720" title="josh beckett style 1" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/josh-beckett-style-1.png" alt="" width="600" height="404" />Beckett is, in my eyes, the lead culprit in the disparaging trend of nausea-inducing magic necklaces and repulsive chin beards that are so common in today's game (there are whole Houston Astros teams from 2007 to 2009 that lionize and emulate Beckett's style the way hipster ladies look to Zooey Deschanel). Back during his rise to prominence with the Marlins in 2003, Beckett was a fresh faced young power pitcher sporting a <a href="http://www.allposters.com/IMAGES/adc/10127551A.jpg">chin disaster</a>. Follies of youth can be excused, if only Beckett had abandoned the gaff in the interim. Instead, he's elevated the chin beard to an <a title="josh beckett" href="http://i.cdn.turner.com/sivault/multimedia/photo_gallery/0802/daytona.500.picks/images/beckett.josh.jpg">art form</a>,&nbsp;like a Thomas Kinkaid painting or a faded tag on a stop sign in Topeka.</p>
<h2>C.C. Sabathia</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3724" title="c.c. sabathia baggy pants" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/c.c.-sabathia-baggy-pants.png" alt="" width="359" height="580" />Big men don't have it easy when it comes to looking good in a baseball uniform. The solution, however, is not to add twenty-four square feet of additional fabric to the ensemble. Plus, he wears his cap less <a href="http://cleveland.indians.mlb.com/mlb/photo/photogallery/2003_2nd_half_moments/cle/05.jpg">crooked/awesome</a> than he used to.</p>
<h2>Hideki Matsui</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3726" title="hideki matsui high pants" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/hideki-matsui-high-pants.png" alt="" width="600" height="400" />Sometimes, a single fatal flaw can sink an entire presentation. In Hideki Matsui's case, it's the grandpa-grade altitude of his waistline.</p>
<h2>Shawn Marcum</h2>
<p><img class="aligncenter size-full wp-image-3737" title="shawn marcum" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/06/shawn-marcum.png" alt="" width="600" height="461" />With his "roadie for the WARPED tour" multi-leveled beard, his "roadie for Led Zeppelin" bell-bottom pants, and his "roadie for the Chili Peppers" necklace menagerie, Shawn Marcum could front a crappy rock band in any of three decades.</p>
