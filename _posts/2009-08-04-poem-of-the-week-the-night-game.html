<p>Tonight I saw one of the best baseball games I have ever seen. It was Mets and Cardinals and Albert Pujols and Johan Santana and everything that game should have been. Mostly it was Albert Pujols. I'll write about the game, I think, tomorrow. But for now, a poem by Robert Pinsky, The Night Game. I just discovered it a few moments ago, and am smitten. Especially with the little haiku about Whitey Ford you'll find halfway down. "A mere success," Pinsky calls Ford. How many people would give up years, limbs, loves for the chance to be a "mere success?" Ask the poet, ask the pitcher (not Ford) Pinsky refers to at the end of this poem:</p>
<blockquote><p><img class="alignright size-full wp-image-835" title="robert pinsky poet basebal card" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/08/robert-pinsky-card.jpg" alt="robert pinsky poet basebal card" width="214" height="302" />Some of us believe<br />
We would have conceived romantic<br />
Love out of our own passions<br />
With no precedents,<br />
Without songs and poetry--<br />
Or have invented poetry and music</p>
<p>As a comb of cells for the honey.</p>
<p>Shaped by ignorance,<br />
A succession of new worlds,<br />
Congruities improvised by<br />
Immigrants or children.</p>
<p>I once thought most people were Italian,<br />
Jewish or Colored.<br />
To be white and called<br />
Something like Ed Ford<br />
Seemed aristocratic,<br />
A rare distinction.</p>
<p>Possibly I believed only gentiles<br />
And blonds could be left-handed.</p>
<p>Already famous<br />
After one year in the majors,<br />
Whitey Ford was drafted by the Army<br />
To play ball in the flannels<br />
Of the Signal Corps, stationed<br />
In Long Branch, New Jersey.</p>
<p>A night game, the silver potion<br />
Of the lights, his pink skin<br />
Shining like a burn.</p>
<p>Never a player<br />
I liked or hated: a Yankee,<br />
A mere success.</p>
<p>But white the chalked-off lines<br />
In the grass, white and green<br />
The immaculate uniform,<br />
And white the unpigmented<br />
Halo of his hair<br />
When he shifted his cap:</p>
<p>So ordinary and distinct,<br />
So close up, that I felt<br />
As if I could have made him up,<br />
Imagined him as I imagined</p>
<p>The ball, a scintilla<br />
High in the black backdrop<br />
Of the sky. Tight red stitches.<br />
Rawlings. The bleached</p>
<p>Horsehide white: the color<br />
Of nothing. Color of the past<br />
And of the future, of the movie screen<br />
At rest and of blank paper.</p>
<p>"I could have." The mind. The black<br />
Backdrop, the white<br />
Fly picked out by the towering<br />
Lights. A few years later</p>
<p>On a blanket in the grass<br />
By the same river<br />
A girl and I came into<br />
Being together<br />
To the faint muttering<br />
Of unthinkable<br />
Troubadours and radios.</p>
<p>The emerald<br />
Theater, the night.<br />
Another time,<br />
I devised a left-hander<br />
Even more gifted<br />
Than Whitey Ford: A Dodger.<br />
People were amazed by him.<br />
Once, when he was young,<br />
He refused to pitch on Yom Kippur.</p></blockquote>
