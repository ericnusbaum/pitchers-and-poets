<p><img class="alignleft size-full wp-image-4155" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2011/09/the-art-of-fielding-by-chad-harbach.png" alt="he art of fielding by chad harbach" width="204" height="319" />I first read <em>Siddhartha</em> in my mid-twenties, the perfect time.&nbsp; I had performed all the necessary rites: earned my useless liberal arts degree, failing classes and writing awful songs for the guitar.&nbsp; I had lived overseas and returned; I found a low-paying professional job and wore ties.&nbsp; I joined a bar-league softball team.&nbsp; I joined a book club.</p>
<p>I read <em>Siddhartha</em> and discovered that I hadn&rsquo;t been wasting my life; I&rsquo;d just been honing myself, voyaging unknowingly on a lifelong journey, often in circles but inevitably forward.&nbsp; I was hunting for my Kamala, throwing dice and laughing.&nbsp; Naturally, I ate this up.&nbsp; I brought my notes to the book club and drank other people&rsquo;s merlot, mostly to insert pauses in my own conversations.</p>
<p>What I found so enthralling was the book&rsquo;s sense of velocity, its unending pace toward wisdom or destitution or both.&nbsp; Everything to me was progress, each day a matter of new wisdom and new experience.&nbsp; For the athlete, particularly the baseball player, this is not so.&nbsp; By the time they gain sufficient wisdom, a workable change-up or plate discipline and strength, they have already begun to die.&nbsp; Their every effort must be design to combat this; every misplayed ball, every lazy workout bends a man further from perfection.</p>
<p>In <em>The Art of Fielding, </em>Schwartz uses a machinery metaphor to explain the baseball player, rendering him soulless.&nbsp; There is no sudden beauty, no art, only reliability.&nbsp; Henry, the ideal ballplayer, never deviates, never rests.&nbsp; Finally Henry-the-Machine breaks down and baptizes himself in the lake, no longer able to live among the world without belonging to it.&nbsp; One of Harbach&rsquo;s themes is the shunning of the effects of time: Affenlight hiding from old age, Schwartz adulthood, Henry perfection.&nbsp; The following chapters see Henry efface himself, tear down the temple he has built to himself and baseball, the muscles and sinew eroding.&nbsp; Each day he sleeps through, each decimal of body fat raised, feels like a tragedy.</p>
<p>By the end of Chapter 72 we and Henry have reached a crossroads: where will Harbach take him from here?&nbsp; Siddhartha is dragged from the river by his friend Govinda and finds enlightenment in his emptiness.&nbsp; Will Henry find his own, and what form will it take?&nbsp; Will it be in baseball, a return to the simple joy of the game Aparicio hated to leave?&nbsp; Or will it require the casting off of baseball, a return to the idyllic pasture of the Midwest?</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m in my thirties now, still wandering in circles. &nbsp;I&rsquo;m still reading <em>Siddhartha</em>, still pontificating in book groups.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s no coincidence.&nbsp; I don&rsquo;t have the sort of character, the capacity to achieve Henry&rsquo;s level of greatness, nor his level of misery.&nbsp; I&rsquo;m not driven enough, not myopic enough to concentrate on a single task, put all my chips on one number.&nbsp; Perhaps it&rsquo;s cowardice.&nbsp; But I can&rsquo;t help but disagree when Henry claims that &ldquo;the only life worth living is the unfree life&rdquo;, because he doesn&rsquo;t understand freedom.&nbsp; He sees the cigarettes and women and knowledge as freedom, or an attempt at it, when all they are is another reach for control over one&rsquo;s life.</p>
<p>Freedom is what we see in Owen, in name the Buddha, in reality opportunistic hedonism made practical.&nbsp; Owen needs nothing and takes what&rsquo;s available.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s not life free of pain, as Schwartz hopes for, nor life ignorant of it; it&rsquo;s life free of the fear of pain.&nbsp; &nbsp;It&rsquo;s illicit merlot.&nbsp; It&rsquo;s Aparicio&rsquo;s vision of the game, a samurai code that cannot be broken because it is continually being remade.&nbsp; Sometimes, it&rsquo;s a double-header at shortstop, hoping each ball is hit to you, another chance to do something brilliant.</p>
