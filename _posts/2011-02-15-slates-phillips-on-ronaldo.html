  content: Gotta say I am in the "...so boring..." stage of my soccer fandom. I bartended
    during the World Cup and tried to foment my love of soccer  by watching it with
    live or die fans. Didn't work. It's still a game built on frustration.

<p>I don't know a lot about soccer. I'm your typical late-comer who enjoys the aesthetic side of the game without having the greatest sense of its history. I learn what I can, and I enjoy the rest.</p>
<p>The great player Ronaldo, who just retired, is typical of the cultural marker that I know of without really understanding. He peaked when I was still in my "I hate soccer it's so boring" phase, which is I think a trial that every matured sports fan must complete and then leave behind, making room for the more justified distastes for NASCAR and golf. By the time I started paying attention, Rooney and Cristiano Ronaldo were the stars of the day, attracting all the love and ire of 5 billion soccer fans across the world.</p>
<p>That said, I found <a href="http://www.slate.com/id/2285094/">Brian Phillips' summation of Ronaldo's career and public persona in Slate</a> an article worth reading with the balanced levels of insight, thought, and perspective that I try to bring to P&amp;P content.</p>
<p>I don't understand Ronaldo by reading the article, but I understand how a fan watched Ronaldo play, and what sort of a once-removed relationship there was between fan and player and media. Of note:</p>
<blockquote><p>As a media figure, Ronaldo was never cool in the ruthless-visionary way of Zidane or in the lost-album-cover manner of Beckham. He seemed affable, funny, a little ingenuous, a little strange. Those qualities&nbsp;<a href="http://www.guardian.co.uk/football/2003/jun/19/newsstory.sport" target="_blank">made him human</a>, but they also made him a terrible fit for modern sports journalism, which knows how to handle only one kind of superstar&mdash;the kind who is entirely focused on being one.</p></blockquote>
<p>And:</p>
<blockquote><p>Over the years, Ronaldo somehow contrived to become the leading scorer in World Cup history, to become, with Zidane, the defining player of his generation, and yet, simultaneously, to become a joke.</p></blockquote>
<p>I would also urge you to watch the highlight films, which show a player full of talent, in which "talent" is the barely visible ability to create space and opportunity where none appeared to have been.</p>
