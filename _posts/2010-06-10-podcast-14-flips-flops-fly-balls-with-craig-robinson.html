    I am of you two also.\r\n\r\nQuick question: what was the music at the end of

  content: "Great podcast.\r\n\r\nI'm glad the Strasburg debut exposed you to Nationals
    announcers. If there is one human who best fits the description \"polar opposite
    of Vin Scully,\" it is Rob Dibble. That guy yells for balls to go over the heads
    of opposing outfielders while his partner is trying to give the play-by-play.
    I've even heard him cheer an opposing player make an error resulting in a Nationals
    run. They're the worst."

  content: "Awesome podcast guys.  Robinson's work is some of my favorite on the Internet,
    and you guys are with words what he is with images.  A great combination leading
    to a great conversation.\r\n\r\nThanks!"

<p>In Podcast 14 we are joined by illustrator Craig Robinson of the brilliant <a href="http://flipflopflyball.com">Flip Flop Fly Ball</a>.&nbsp; We use the word Brilliant, in part, because Mr. Robinson is English. How and why an Englishman became baseball's foremost progenitor of cerebral infographics is our main topic of discussion. Also: Vladmir Putin's chest, Stephen Strasburg's socks, the best and worst in major league uniforms.</p>
