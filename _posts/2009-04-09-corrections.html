<p>In baseball, when you screw up and let a ball go through your legs, there's no going back and fixing it. You hate yourself for a while, try to look confident, and pray to god it doesn't lead to any runs. Thankfully, when you screw up in blogging, there's an easy way to fix it. Just write another post. Hopefully this won't be a recurring feature.</p>
<p>And with that in mind, two apologies:</p>
<p>First to Ted Walker of <a href="http://alamosweet.wordpress.com">Waiting For Berkman</a>. Sorry for calling you <a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/2009/03/31/alex-rodriguez-tragic-hero-part-ii/">Ted Miller the other day</a>. And thanks for politely not mentioning it. </p>
<p>Second to the ghost of William Carlos Williams. Commenter Mick points out that I only included part of Williams' poem The Crowd At The Ballgame in a Poem Of The Week post way back in March. It was a sloppy cut/paste error on my part, and I've <a href="http://www.writing.upenn.edu/~afilreis/88v/ballgame.html">reproduced the poem in full</a> below. It's worth a read:</p>
<p>The crowd at the ball game<br />
is moved uniformly</p>
<p>by a spirit of uselessness<br />
which delights them--</p>
<p>all the exciting detail<br />
of the chase</p>
<p>and the escape, the error<br />
the flash of genuis--</p>
<p>all to no end save beauty<br />
the eternal--</p>
<p>So in detail they, the crowd,<br />
are beautiful</p>
<p>for this<br />
to be warned against</p>
<p>saluted and defied--<br />
It is alive, venomous</p>
<p>it smiles grimly<br />
its words cut--</p>
<p>The flashy female with her<br />
mother, gets it--</p>
<p>The Jew gets it straight--it<br />
is deadly, terrifying--</p>
<p>It is the Inquisition, the<br />
Revolution</p>
<p>It is beauty itself<br />
that lives</p>
<p>day by day in them<br />
idly--</p>
<p>This is<br />
the power of their faces</p>
<p>It is summer, it is the solstice<br />
the crowd is</p>
<p>cheering, the crowd is laughing<br />
in detail</p>
<p>permanently, seriously<br />
without thought</p>
