<p>I spoke with <a href="http://kenlevine.blogspot.com">Ken Levine</a>, television writer and Mariners' broadcaster, last week for an article I'm writing elsewhere. The conversation turned at one point to scorekeeping, and he shared this tidbit on Vin Scully:</p>
<blockquote><p>Normally I can look over somebody's shoulders, I can pick up their scorecard and I can kind of figure it out. With one exception &ndash; Vin Scully. He's got lines and dots and stuff. I have no idea. You need Navajo code breakers to figure out Vin's scorebook. I have no idea.</p></blockquote>
<p>Scully, Levine said, also has the unfortunate habit of throwing his old scorebooks away. (Ernie Harwell, on the other hand, kept everything).</p>
