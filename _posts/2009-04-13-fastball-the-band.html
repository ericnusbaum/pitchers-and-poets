<p>Who knew that the 1990s also-rans with the baseball themed name were still running? I'm pretty sure the red ball on the album cover representst he way their career has whizzed in and out of the public consciousness...like a projectile thrown at high velocity or something. <a href="http://www.amazon.com/Little-White-Lies-Dig-Fastball/dp/B001TD1XXK">New album out the 14th</a> --that's today basically.</p>

<p>I haven't heard any of the new songs, so  can't recommend the record, but I <a href="http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=b0wfu3tOrtQ">do still kind of dig The Way</a> (warning: video not nearly as cool as you might remember it), and may toss them on the mixtape sometime just because of the name.</p>
