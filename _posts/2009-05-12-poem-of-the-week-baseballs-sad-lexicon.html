<p>This is perhaps the second most famous baseball poem of all time. If not, it contains one of the most famous lines: Tinker to Evers to Chance. Enjoy <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Baseball%27s_Sad_Lexicon">Franklin Pierce Adams'</a> work here, and try to remember that there was a time when the words Chicago and Cubs did not add up to inevitable failure</p>
<blockquote style="text-align: left;"><dl>
<dd>These are the saddest of possible words:</dd>
<dd>"Tinker to Evers to Chance."</dd>
<dd>Trio of bear cubs, and fleeter than birds,</dd>
<dd>Tinker and Evers and Chance.</dd>
<dd>Ruthlessly pricking our gonfalon bubble,</dd>
<dd>Making a Giant hit into a double --</dd>
<dd>Words that are heavy with nothing but trouble:</dd>
<dd>"Tinker to Evers to Chance."</dd>
</dl>
</blockquote>
<p>*Gonfalon, wikipedia points out, means pennant.</p>
