    Monch's \"Official\"</a> isn't about just baseball, but references it repeatedly.\r\n\r\nAnd
    it's not Nelly."

<p><a href="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/mixtape1.jpg"><img class="alignleft size-medium wp-image-480" title="mixtape1" src="http://pitchersandpoets.com/wp-content/uploads/2009/06/mixtape1-300x190.jpg" alt="mixtape1" width="240" height="153" /></a>I wanted to get some hip hop onto the baseball mixtape but felt like not using Nelly. Google led me to Natural Resource, a shortlived indie group from the 1990s. Good info on Natural Resource is scarce, but they were the launching point for eminently talented female artist named <a href="http://www.myspace.com/jeangrae">Jean Grae</a> -- then known as What? What? The best writeup I've seen on this song is from a blog called <a href="http://djespionage.blogspot.com/2006/08/natural-resource-negro-league-baseball.html">Twelve Inchers</a>, who cite these <a href="http://www.lyricsondemand.com/n/naturalresourcelyrics/negroleaguebaseballlyrics.html">lyrics </a> and wonder if the track is really about baseball at all:</p>
<blockquote><p><em>Baseball was never for blacks. (What?)<br />
It used to be a pasttime for whites. (That's true.)<br />
Now it has mad Puerto Ricans. (Uh oh)<br />
But that's not the point of the song. (A-ight)<br />
The point of this song, and I make it mad simple, when I be flippin' this script:<br />
Is that the industry is all over the mound, pitchin', but nobody's makin' any hits.<br />
Baseball is not just a sport<br />
It's the verbal/mental/physical/spiritual/emotional level that we are on<br />
It's about time that all you devils was gone...</em></p></blockquote>
<p>What makes this song great, aside from being catchy and clever and all that stuff, is the way it kind of teases and flips the baseball metaphor. Sure, "I hit a lot of homeruns" can be a more interesting way to say "I record a lot of hit songs," but that's easy and a cliche (see, once again, <a href="http://www.sing365.com/music/lyric.nsf/Batter-Up-lyrics-Nelly/32C7126F2627C77648256915000CE0DF">Nelly</a>).&nbsp; So Natural Resource acknowledges that. They even lay out some rhymes along those lines: "First batter up well here's the pitch that's a curve/Second batter up because the first got served" before subverting the whole notion. Baseball after all, is a deeply flawed institution, just like the music industry, where exploitation on class and racial lines can overshadow talent. Talent that a group like Natural Resource (or an old Negro Leaguer like, say,&nbsp; Cool Papa Bell) has but can't capitalize on for reasons beyond their control. You see a lot of baseball metaphors related to play on the field, but not too many based on the socio-economic dynamics and history of the game.<br />
