    not "anyways" in the 2nd to last line. -S

<p>Here's a poem from <a href="http://www.poets.org/poet.php/prmPID/70">James Tate</a>.</p>
<blockquote><p>The Buddhists have the ball field. Then the teams<br />
arrive, nine on one, but only three on the other.<br />
The teams confront the Buddhists. The Buddhists<br />
present their permit. There is little point in<br />
arguing it, for the Buddhists clearly have the<br />
permit for the field. And the teams have nothing,<br />
not even two complete teams. It occurs to one team<br />
manager to interest the Buddhists in joining his<br />
team, but the Buddhists won&rsquo;t hear of it. The teams<br />
walk away with their heads hung low. A gentle rain<br />
begins. It would have been called anyway, they<br />
think suddenly.</p></blockquote>
